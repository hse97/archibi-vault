**Set**
	collection of distinct elements
	**Add**
		operation adds an element to a set provided an equal element doesn't already exist in the set 
	A set is an unordered collection 

### Element Keys and Removal 
Set elements may be primitive data values, such as numbers or strings or objects w/ numerous data members 
when storing objects, set implementation distinguishes elements based on elements key value
**Key Value**
	a primitive data value that serves as a unique identifier for the element 
	ex. an object for a student at a university may store information such as name, nummber, ID
	no 2 students will have same ID so the ID can be used as student's object's key
Adding/removing is based on key value 
**Remove**
	operation removes element w/ specified key value 

### Searching and Subsets
**Search**
	operation returns set element w/ the specified key, or null if no such elements exist 
	the search operation can be used to implement a subset text 
**Subset**
	a set X is a subset of Y only if every element of X is also an element of Y 
	every set is a subset of itself
