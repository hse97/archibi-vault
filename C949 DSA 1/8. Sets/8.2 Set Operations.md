### Union, Intersection, and Difference 
**Union**
	the union of sets X and Y (X ∪ Y) is a set that contains every element from X and every element from Y and no other elements 
**Intersection**
	(X ∩ Y)contains every element that is in both X and Y and no other elements 
**Difference**
	(X \ Y) contains every element in X but not in Y 

The Union and Intersection operations are commutative 
	X ∪ Y = Y ∪ X and X ∩ Y = Y ∩ X
The difference operation is not commutative 

### Filter and Map 
**Filter**
	operation on set X produces a subset containing only elements from X that satisfy a particular condition 
	That condition for filtering is commonly represented by a **Filter Predicate**
		a function that takes an element as an arg and returns a bool value indicating whether or not that element will be in the filtered subset 
**Map**
	operation on set X produces a new set by applying some function F to each element 
	you're doing F(set) for every element in the set basically
