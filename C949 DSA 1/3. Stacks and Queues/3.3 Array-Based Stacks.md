stack can be implemented with array 
two variables are needed in addition to array 
	**AllocationSize**
		int for array's allocated size
	**Length**
		int for stack's length 
stacks bottom item is at array[0] and top item is at array[length - 1]
if stack empty, length = 0

**Unbounded Stack**
	stack with no upper limit on length 
	can increase indefinitely so stacks allocation size must also be able to increase indefinitely 
	when stack length is reached, array size is doubled 

**Bounded Stack**
	stack with a length that does not exceed a maximum value 
	maximum commonly the initial allocation size 
	bounded stack with length == allocation size said to be **FULL**
	max length does not always equal allocation size
		if max length > allocation size, array will be resized until max length is possible to reach
