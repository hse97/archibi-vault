### Array-Based Queue Storage
two addtl variables needed in addition to the array 
	**Length**
		an integer for the queue's length 
	**front_index**
		an integer for the queue's front item index 
The queue's content starts at `array[front_index]` and continues forward through `length` items 
If array end is reached before encountering all items, the remaining items are stored starting at index 0 
	Basically the front of the queue can be different then the start of the array. Meaning you can start the array at say array[2] and it will just loop back all the way to array[1] where array[2] is front and array[1] is back 
		the array can also hold items that are not in the queue if the length is shorter than the items in the queue 
			i.e array lenght = 3 but array size is 4, one item in array will not be in the queue 
		Array can also be full but length = 0 meaning the queue is empty

### Bounded v.s Unbounded Queue 
**Bounded Queue**
	queue with length that does not exceed a specified max value 
	addtl variable `max_length` is needed 
		commonly assigned at construction and does not change for queue's lifetime 
	bounded queue with length == `max_length` is said to be **full**

**Unbounded Queue**
	queue with length that can grow indefinitely 

### Flexible Implementation and Resize Operation 
array-based queue implementation can support both bounded and unbounded queue operations by using `max_length` as follows: 
	`max_length == negative` the queue is unbounded
	`max_length == non-negative` the queue is bounded 
The python implementation uses a list named `queue_list` to store queue items
	`len(queue_list)` is the queue's allocation size 
when resizing an a queue with an array, the front of the queue is always re-shaped in a way that the front of the queue is at `array[0]

### Enqueue and Dequeue Operations 
**Enqueue Operation**
	1. Compares self.length and self.max_length 
		if equal the queue is full so no change occurs an false is returned 
	2. compares self.length and len(self.queue_list)
		if equal resize operations occurs 
	3. Comptues the enqueued item's index as `(self.front_index + self.length) % len(self.queue_list)` and assigns to queue_list at that index
		Ex: enqueueing 42 into a queue with a front index 2, length 3, and queue_list length of 8 assigns queue_list at index(2 + 3) % 8 = 5 with 42 
	4. Increments the length attribute and then returns true 
**Dequeue Operation**
	1. makes copy of the list item at front_index 
	2. Decrement length 
	3. increments front_index, resetting to 0 if the incremented value equals the allocation size 
	4. returns the list item from step 1
