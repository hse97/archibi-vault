queues are often implemented using a linked list with lists's head node representing front of queue and tail node representing the queue's end 
Enqueue an item is performed by creating a new list node, assigning the node's data with the item, and appending the node to the list 
Dequeing is performed by assigning a local variable iwht the head node's data, removing the head node from the list, and returning the local variable
