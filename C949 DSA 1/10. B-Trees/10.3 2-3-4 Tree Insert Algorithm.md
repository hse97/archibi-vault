**Insert** operation inserts the new key in the proper location such that all 2-3-4 tree properties are preserved
New keys are always inserted into leaf nodes in a 2-3-4 tree
Insertion returns the leaf node where the key was inserted or null if the key was already in the tree 
An important operation during insertion is the **split** operation 
	done on every full node encountered during insertion traversal 
The split operation moves the middle key from a child node into the child's parent node 
The first and last keys in the child node are moved into two separate nodes 
The split operation returns the parent node that recieved the middle key from teh child 

### Inserting a key into a leaf node
A new key is always inserted into a non-full leaf node 

4 possible ways to insert a new key into a non-full leaf node

|Condition|Outcome|
|---|---|
|New key equals an existing key in node|No insertion takes place, and the node is not altered.|
|New key is < node's first key|Existing keys in node are shifted right, and the new key becomes node's first key.|
|Node has only 1 key or new key is < node's middle key|Node's middle key , if present, becomes last key, and new key becomes node's middle key.|
|None of the above|New key becomes node's last key.|

### B-Tree insert w/ Pre-Emptive Split 
**Preemptive Split**
	always splits any full node encountered during insertion traversal 
	ensures any time a full node is split, the parent node has room to accommodate the middle value from the child
