### Merge Algorithm 
**Merge**
	operates on a node with 1 key and increases the node's keys to 2 or 3 using either a rotation or a fusion 
	A node's 2 adjacent siblings are checked first during a merge, if either has 2 or more keys, a key is transferred via a rotation 
		the rotation increases the # of keys from 1 to 2 
	If all adjacent siblings of the node being merged have 1 key, then fusion is used to increase the number of keys in the node from 1 to 3 
	The merge operation can be performed on any node that has 1 key and a non-null parent node with at least 2 keys 

### Remove Algorithm 
**Remove**
	removes first-found matching key 
	restructures tree to preserve all 2-3-4 rules 
	each removal -> one key removed 
	a key can be removed from a leaf node that has 2 or more keys 
	**Preemptive Merge** removal scheme involves increasing the number of keys in all single-key, non-root nodes encountered during traversal 
	The merging always happens before any key removal is attempted 
	Ensures any leaf node encountered has >=2 keys allowing a key to be removed from a leaf node w/o violating 2-3-4 rules 
	when removing a key from an internal node, it is replaced w/ either the min key from the right subtree or max key from the left subtree 
	key chosen for removal is stored in a temp variable, then chosen key is removed recursively, then lastly the temporary key replaces the key to be removed
