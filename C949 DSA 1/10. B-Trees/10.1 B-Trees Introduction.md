In a Binary Tree, each node has one key and up to two children
**B-Tree**
	has an **Order**, K
	nodes can have up to K-1 keys 
	nodes can have up to K children 
	**Order**
		maximum # of children a node can have 

Some rules: 
	All Keys in B-tree must be distinct 
	All leaf nodes must be at same level
	an internal node with N keys must have N+1 children
	Keys in a node are stored in sorted order from smallest to largest 
	Each key in a B-Tree internal node has one left subtree and one right subtree 
		All left subtree keys are < that key 
		all right subtree keys are > that key

### Higher Order B-Trees
As the order of B-Trees increases, the max # of keys and childre/node increases 
An internal node must have one more child than keys 
Each child of an internal node can have a different # of keys than the parent internal node 
	Ex: an internal node in an order 5 B-Tree could have 1 child with 1 key, 2 children with 3 keys, and 2 children with 4 keys 

### 2-3-4 Trees
is an order 4 B-Tree
Therefore, 2-3-4 tree's node contains 1, 2, or 3 keys 
a leaf node has no children 

keys and children are commonly referred to by index 
So keys are called key 0, key 1, key 2
children are called child 0, child 1, child 2
if a node contains two keys, then key 2 and child 3 are not used
said to be **Full** if node contains all 3 keys
