Given a key, a **search** algo returns the first node found matching that key, or null if a matching node is not found 
search on a 2-3-4 tree is recursive and starts with the root node 
If the search key equals any of the keys in the node, then the node is returned 
otherwise recursive call is made on appropriate child node
Which child node is used depends on the value of the search key in comparison to the node's keys 
The table below shows conditions which are checked in order, and the corresponding child nodes
