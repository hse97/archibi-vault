**Rotation**
	A rearrangement of keys between 3 nodes that maintains all 2-3-4 tree properties
	The 2-3-4 tree removal algorithm uses rotations to transfer keys between sibling nodes 
**Right Rotation**
	on a node causes the node to lose one key and the node's right sibling to gain one key 
**Left Rotation**
	causes the node to lose a key and the node's left sibling to gain one key 

### Fusion
When rearranging values in a 2-3-4 tree during deletions, rotations are not an option for nodes that do not have a sibling with 2 or more keys 
**Fusion**
	a combination of 3 keys: 2 from adjacent sibling nodes that have 1 key each, and a third from the parent of the siblings 
	Inverse of a split 
	Key taken from the parent node must be the key that is between the 2 adjacent siblings 
	Parent node must have at least 2 keys with exception of the root 
		Fusion of the root node is a special case
		happens only when the root and the root's 2 children each have 1 key 
		in this case, the 3 keys from the 3 nodes are combined into a single node 
		that single node becomes the new root node
