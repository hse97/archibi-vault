**File Systems**
trees are commonly used to represent hierarchical data 
a tree can represent files and directories in a file system, since they are hierarchy 

### Binary Space Partitioning 
**Binary Space Partitioning (BSP)**
	technique of repeatedly separating a region of space into 2 parts and cataloging objects contained within the region 
	**BSP Tree**
		binary tree used to store information for binary space partitioning 
		each node in a BSP tree contains information about a region of space and which objects are contained in the region 
		A BSP tree can be used to store all objects in a multidimensional world 
		The BSP tree can then be used to efficiently determine which objects must be rendered on screen 
		The viewer's position in space is used to perform a lookup within the BSP tree 
		The lookup quickly eliminates a large number of objects that are not visible and therefore should not be rendered
