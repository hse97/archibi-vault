### Overview
**Trie**
	a tree representing a set of strings 
	each non-root node represents a single character
	each node has at most one child per distinct alphabet character 
	**Terminal Node** a node that represents a terminating character which is the end of a string in the trie 
Tries provide efficient storage and quick search for strings 
often used to implement auto-complete and predictive text input 

### Trie Insert Algo 
creates a path from the root to the terminal node that visits all the string's characters in sequence
a current node pointer initially points to the root
	a loop iterates thru the string's characters 
For each character C: 
	a new child node is added only if the current node does not have a child for C
	the cur node pointer is assigned with the cur node's child for C 
After all characters are processed a terminal node is added and returned

### Trie Search Algo 
returns the terminal node corresponding to that string, or null if string not in trie

### Trie Remove algo 
removes the string's corresponding terminal node and all non-root ancestors with 0 children 

### Time Complexity 
implementations commonly use a lookup table for a trie node's children, allowing retrieval of a child node from a character in O(1) time
Therefore, to insert, remove, or search for a string of length M in trie takes O(M) time
size does not effect time complexity
