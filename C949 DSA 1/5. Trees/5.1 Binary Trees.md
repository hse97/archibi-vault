### Basics
In a list, each node has up to one successor 
**Binary Trees**
	each node has up to two children, known as **left child** and **right child**
	**Leaf**
		tree node with no children
	**Internal Node**
		node with at least one child 
	**Parent**
		node with a child is said to be that child's parent. A node's **ancestors** include the node's parent, the parent's parent, etc up to the tree's root 
	**Root**
		the one tree node with no parent/top node

### Depth, Level, and Height 
**Edge**
	link from a node to a child 
**Depth**
	number of edges on the path from root to the node. The root node thus has depth 0
**Level**
	all nodes with the same depth form a tree level 
**Height**
	the largest depth of any node. A tree with just one node has height 0

### Special types of binary trees
**Full**
	if every node contains 0 or 2 children 
**Complete**
	if all levels, except possibly the last level, contain all possible nodes and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible 
**Perfect**
	if all internal nodes have 2 children, and all leaf nodes are on the same level
