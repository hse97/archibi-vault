**Remove**
	removes the first-found matching node
		restructures tree to preserve BST ordering property 
	the algo first seraches for a matching node just like the search algo 
	if found the algo performs one of the following sub-algos
		Remove a Leaf Node:
			if X has a parent node (X is not root) the parent's left or right child (whichever poitnts to X), is assigned with null.
			else if X was root, the root pointer is assinged with null and BST is now empty 

remove algo traverses the tree from root to find the node to remove 
when node being removed has two children, the node's successor is found and a recursive call is made 
one node is visited per level and in the worst case scenario the tree is traversed twice from the root to the leaf 
a BST with N nodes has at least log_2(N) levels and at most N levels 
so removal's worst case time complexity is O(logN) for a BST with log_2(N) and worst case O(N) for a tree with N levels 
Two pointers are used to traverse the tree during removal 
when the node being removed has two children, a third pointer and a copy of one node's data are also used, and one recursive call is made. 
So removal's space complexity is always O(1)
