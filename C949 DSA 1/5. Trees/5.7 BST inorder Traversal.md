**Tree Traversal**
	algo visits all nodes in the tree once and performs and operation on each node
	an **inorder traversal** visits all nodes in a BST from smallest to Largest which is useful for example to print the tree's nodes in sorted order 
	Starting from root, the aglo recursively prints the left subtree, the current node, and the right subtree
