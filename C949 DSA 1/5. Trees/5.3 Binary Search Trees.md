**Binary Search Trees**
	useful form of binary tree
	has an ordering property that any node's left subtree keys <= node's key and any right subtree's keys >= the node's key 
	property enables fast searching of an item 

### Searching 
to **Search** means to find a node with a desired key if such node exists 
a BST yields faster searches than a list 
if a child to be visited doesn't exist, the desired node DNE 
	this method means only a small fraction of nodes need to be compared 

### BST Search Runtime
searching BST worst case requries H + 1 comparisons where H is height 
	meaning O(H)
major benefit of BST is an N-Node's binary tree height may be as small as O(LogN) yielding extremely fast searches 
	Ex: a 10,000 node list may be required 10,000 comparisons but a BST may only require 14 comparisons 
A binary tree's height can be minimized by keeping all levels full except possibly the last level 
Such an "'all but last level full" binary tree's height is H = floor_func(log_2(N))

### Successors and Predecessors 
BST defines an ordering among nodes, from smallest to largest 
**Successor**
	node that comes after in the BST ordering 
		so in ABC, A's successor is B
**Predecessor**
	node that comes before in the BST ordering
		so in ABC, A is the predecessor to B 
If a node has a right subtree, the node's successor is the right subtree's leftmost child
	starting from the right subtree's root, follow the left children until reaching a node with no left children (may be the subtree's root itself)
If a node doesn't have a right subtree, the nodes' sucessor is the first ancestor having this node in a left subtree
