BST implementation often includes a parent pointer inside each node
a balanced BST such as an AVL tree or a red-black tree, may utilize the parent pointer to traverse up the tree from a particular node to find a parent, grandparent, or sibling node
the BST insertion and removal algorithm below inserts or removes nodes in a BST with nodes containing parent pointers
