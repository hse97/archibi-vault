**Height**
	maximum edges from root to any leaf , one-node tree has height = 0
minimum n-node binary tree height is h = floor_func(log_2(N))
acheived when each level is full except possibly the last
The maximum N-node binary tree height is N -1 
searching a BST is fast if the tree's height is near the minimum 
inserting items in rando order naturally keeps a BST's height near minimum
Inserting items in nearly-sorted order leads to nearly maximum tree height 

### BSTGetHeight Algo
given node representing a BST subtree, the height can be computed as follows
if the node is null, return -1
Otherwise recursively compute the left and right child subtree heights, and return 1 plus the greater of the 2 child subtree's heights
