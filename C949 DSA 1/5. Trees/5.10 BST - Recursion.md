### BST Recursive Search Algo 
BST search can be implemented using recursion
A single node and a search key are passed as arguments to the recursive search function 
Two base cases exist 
First base case is when the node is null, in which case null is returned 
If the node is non-null, then the search key is compared to the node's key 
The second base case is when the search key equals the node's key in which case the node is returned 

### BST Get Parent Algo 
BST get-parent algo searches for a parent in a way similar to the normal BST search algo 
instead of comparing the serach key with a canidate node key, the search key is compared with the keys of the candidate's node's children 

### Recursive BST insertion and removal 
BST insertion and removal can also be implemented using recursion 
The insertion algorithm uses recursion to traverse down the tree until the insertion location is found 
REmove algo uses recusive search function to find the node and the node's parents and then removes the node from the tree
If the node to remove is an internal node with 2 children, the node's successor is recursively removed
