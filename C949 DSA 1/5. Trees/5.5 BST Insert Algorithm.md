**Insert**
	inserts new node in a proper location obeying the BST ordering property 
	a simple BST insert algo compares the new node with the current node (init root)
	Insert as left Child
		if the new node's key is less than the current node, and the curren node's left child is null, the algo assigns that node's left child with the new node
	Insert as right child
		if the new node's key is >= to cur node, and the cur node's right child is null, the algo assigns the node's right child with the new node
	Search for insert location 
		if the left or right child is not null, the algo assigns the cur node with that child and continues searching for proper insert location 

the BST insert algo traverses the tree from root to leaf node to find the insertion location 
one node is visited per level 
a BST with N nodes has at least log_2(N) levels and at most N levels 
runtime complexity is best case O(log N) and worst case O(N)
The space complexity of insertion is O(1) because only a single pointer is used to traverse the tree to find the insertion location
