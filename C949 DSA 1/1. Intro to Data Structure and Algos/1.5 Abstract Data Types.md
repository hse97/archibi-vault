### Abstract Data Types (ADTs)
Data type described by predefined user operations, such as 'insert data at rear', without indicating how each operation is implemented 
An ADT can be implemented using different underlying data structures 
A programmer doesn't need to have knowledge of underlying implementation to use an ADT 
	ex. A list is a common ADT for holding ordered data, having operations like append a data item, remove a data item, search whether data item exists, and print the list. 
	A list ADT is commonly implemented using arrays or linked list data structures 

### Common ADTS
**List**
	holding ordered data 
		array, linked list
**Dynamic Array**
	holding ordered data and allowing indexed access
		array 
**Stack**
	items are only inserted or removed from the top of a stack 
		linked list
**Queue**
	items are inserted at the end of the queue and removed from the front of the queue
		Linked list
**Deque**
	items can be inserted and removed from both front and back
		Linked List
**Bag**
	storing items in which order does not matter and duplicates are allowed
		array, linked list
**Set**
	collection of distinct items
		Binary search tree, hash table
**Priority Queue**
	a queue where each item has a priority, and items with higher priority are closer to the front of the queue than items with lower priority 
		Heap 
**Dictionary**
	associates (maps) keys with values 
		Hash table, binary search tree
