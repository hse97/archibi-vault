### Abstraction and Optimization 
Abstractions means to have a user interact with an item at a high-level, with lower-level internal details hidden from the user. ADTs support abstraction by hiding the underlying implementation details and providing a well-defined set of operations for using the ADT. 
Allows programmers or algo designers to focus on higher-level operations and algos, thus improving programmer efficiency. However, knowledge of the underlying implementation is needed to analyze or improve the runtime efficiency. 

### ADTs in Standard Libraries 
|Programming language|Library|Common supported ADTs|
|---|---|---|
|Python|Python standard library|list, set, dict, deque|
|C++|Standard template library (STL)|vector, list, deque, queue, stack, set, map|
|Java|Java collections framework (JCF)|Collection, Set, List, Map, Queue, Deque|
