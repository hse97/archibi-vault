### Data Structures
**Data Structure**
	way of organizing, storing, and performing operations on data 
	Operations performed on data structure include accessing or updating store data, searching for specific data, inserting new data, and removing data 

### Basic Data Structures 
**Record**
	a record is the data structure that stores subitem, often called fields, with name associated with each subitem 
**Array**
	an array is a data structure that stores an ordered list of items, where each item is directly accessible by a positional index 
**Linked List**
	a linked list is a data structure that stores an ordered list of items in nodes, where each node stores data and has a pointer to the next node
**Binary Tree**
	a binary tree is a data structure in which each node stores data and has up to two children, known as a left child and a right child 
**Hash Table**
	a hash table is a data structure that stores unordered items by mapping (or hashing) each item to a location in an array
**Max-Heap**
	a tree that maintains the simple property that a node's key is greater than or equal to the node's children's keys. A min-heap is a tree that maintains the simple property that a node's key is less than or equal to the node's children's key 
**Graph**
	for representing connections among items, and consists of vertices connected by edges. A **vertex** represents an item in a graph. An **edge** represents a connection between two vertices in a graph
