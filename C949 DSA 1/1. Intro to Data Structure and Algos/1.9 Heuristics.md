**Heuristic**
	A technique that willingly accepts a non-optimal or less accurate solution in order to improve execution speed

### Heuristic Optimization 
**Heuristic Algorithm**
	an algorithm that quickly determines a near optimal or approximate solution 

**Self-Adjusting Heuristic**
	an algo that modifies a data structure based on how that data structure is used
	Ex: many self-adjusting data structures, such as red-black trees and AVL trees, use a self-adjusting heuristic to keep the tree balanced. Tree balancing organizes data to allow for faster access
