### Overview 
**Dynamic Programming**
	problem solving technique that splits a problem into smaller subproblems, computes and stores solutions to subproblems in memory, and then uses the stored solutions to solve the larger problem 

### Longest Common Substring 
**Longest Common Substring**
	algorithm that takes 2 strings as inputs and determines the longest substring that exists in both strings
	Algo uses dynamic programming
	An entry at i, j in the matrix indicates the length of the longest common substring that ends at character i in the first string and character j in the second 
	and entry will be 0 only if 2 characters the entry corresponds to are not the same 
	The matrix is built one row at a time from the top row to the bottom row 
	each row's entries are filled from left to right 
	an entry is set to 0 if the two characters do not match 
	otherwise the entry at i, j is set to 1 plus the entry in i-1, j-1
