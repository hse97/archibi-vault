**Algorithm**
	describes sequence of steps to solve a computations problem or perform a calculation 
	can be described in English, psudocode, a programming language, hardware, etc 
**Computational Problem**
	specifies an input, a question about the input that can be answered using a computer, and the desired output

| DNA analysis       | Given two DNA sequences from different individuals, what is the longest shared sequence of nucleotides?                  | _Longest common substring problem:_ A longest common substring algorithm determines the longest common substring that exists in two input strings.  <br>  <br>DNA sequences can be represented using strings consisting of the letters A, C, G, and T to represent the four different nucleotides.                                                                |
| Search engines     | Given a product ID and a sorted array of all in-stock products, is the product in stock and what is the product's price? | _Binary search:_ The binary search algorithm is an efficient algorithm for searching a list. The list's elements must be sorted and directly accessible (such as an array).                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Navigation         | Given a user's current location and desired location, what is the fastest route to walk to the destination?              | _Dijkstra's shortest path:_ Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm determines the shortest path from a start vertex to each vertex in a graph.  <br>  <br>The possible routes between two locations can be represented using a graph, where vertices represent specific locations and connecting edges specify the time required to walk between those two locations. |
### Efficient Algorithms and Hard Problems
**NP-Complete**
	Set of problems with no known efficient algorithm exists 
	Have following characteristics: 
		1. No efficient algo has been found to solve an NP-complete problem 
		2. No one has proven that an efficient algo to solve an NP-complete problem is impossible
		3. If an efficient algo exists for one NP-complete problem, then all NP-complete problems can be solved efficiently 
	By knowing a problem is NP-Complete, instead of finding an efficient algo, focus on finding an algo to efficiently find a good but non-optimal solution
