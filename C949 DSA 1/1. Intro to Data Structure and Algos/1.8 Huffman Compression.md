### Basic Compression Idea
**Compression**
	transforms data to use fewer bits 
	can be communicated faster than uncompressed data 
	encode frequently occurring items using fewer bits 

### Huffman Coding
common compression technique that assigns fewer bits to frequent items, using a binary tree 
determines frequency of each item 
each item is a leaf node in a tree
Each leaf's nodes encoding is obtained by traversing from the top node to the leaf. Each left branch appends a 0, each right branch appends a 1 to the code

The dictionary must be included along with compressed data to enable decompression 

### Building a Huffman Tree
Data members in a Huffman tree node depend on the node type 
	Leaf nodes have two data members:
		character from the input and an integer frequency for that character 
		Internal nodes have left and right child nodes, along with an integer frequency value that represent the sum of the left and right child frequencies 

### Getting Huffman Codes
Built from a huffman tree
each character corresponds to a leaf node 
Huffman code for a character is built by tracing a path from the root to that characters's leaf node, appending 0 when branching left or 1 when branching right 

### Compressing Data 
First huffman codes are obtained for each character 
Each character of the input string is processed, and corresponding bit codes are concatenated to produce the compressed result 

### Decompressing Huffman Coded Data 
use huffman tree and trace the branches for each bit, starting at the root 
When the final node of the branch is reached, the result has been found 
The process continues  until the entire item is decompressed
