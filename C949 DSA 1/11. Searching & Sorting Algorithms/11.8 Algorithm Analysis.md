### Worst-Case Algorithm Analysis 
To determine how algo scales as input scales, we determine how many operations the algo executes for a specific input size N 
then big-O notation for that function is determined 
Algo runtime analysis often focuses on the worst-case runtime complexity 
**Worst-Case Runtime**
	runtime that results in longest execution
