### Recursive Algorithms
an algorithm that calls itself
an algorithm that breaks the problem into smaller subproblems and applies the algorithm itself to solve the smaller subproblems
a recursive algorithm must have a **base case**
	a case where the algorithm completes without applying itself to a smaller subproblems
