sorting algo that treats the input as a collection of interleaved lists, and sorts each list individually with a variant of the insertion sort algo 
Shell sort uses gap values to determine the number of interleaved lists 
**Gap Value**
	positive integer representing the distance between eleements in an interleaved list 
	For each interleaved list, if an element is at index i, the next element is at index i + gap value 
	Shell sort begins by chosing a gap value K and sorting K interleaved lists in place 
	Shell sort finishes by performing a standard insertion sort on the entire array
