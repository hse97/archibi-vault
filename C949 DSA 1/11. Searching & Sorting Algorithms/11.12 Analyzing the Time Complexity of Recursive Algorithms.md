The runtime complexity T(N) of a recursive function will have function T on both sides of the equation 
Known as a **Recurrence Relation**
	a function f(N) that is defined in terms of the same function operating on a value < N

**Recursion Tree**
	visual diagram of an operation done by a recursive function that separates operations done direction by the function and operations done by the recursive calls
