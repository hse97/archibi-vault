**Algorithm Efficiency**
	typically measured by the algo's computational complexity 
**Computational Complexity**
	the amount of resources used by the algorithm 
		commonly considered are runtime and memory usage
**Runtime Complexity**
	a function, T(N)
	represents the number of constant time operations performed by the algorithm on an input size of N
**Best Case**
	scenario where algorithm does the minimum possible number of operations 
**Worst Case**
	scenario where algo does maximum possible number of operations 

### Space Complexity 
**Space Complexity**
	a function S(N)
	represents the number of fixed-sized memory united used by the algorithm for an input size of N 
**Auxiliary Space Complexity**
	the space complexity not included in the input data 
		i.e temporary variables created during the runtime
