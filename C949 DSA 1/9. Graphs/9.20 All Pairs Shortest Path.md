 Determines shortest path between all possible pairs of vertices in a graph 
 For graphs with vertices, V, then a |V| x |V| matrix represents the shortest path length between all vertex pairs in the graph 
 Each row corresponds to a start vertex, and each column in the matrix corresponds to a terminating vertex for each path 
 Ex: The matrix entry at row F and column T represents the shortest path length from vertex F to vertex T 

### Floyd-Warshall Algorithm 
generates a |V| x |V| matrix of values representing the shortest path lengths between all vertex pairs in a graph 
can have cycles and negative edge weights, but no negative cycles may exist 

Initializes the shortest path matrix in 3 steps: 
1. Every entry is assigned with infinity 
2. Each entry representing the path from a vertex to itself is assigned 0 
3. Each edge from X to Y in the graph, the matrix entry for the path from X to Y is initialized with the edge weight
