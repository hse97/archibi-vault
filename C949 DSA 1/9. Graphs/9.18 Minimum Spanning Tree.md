**Minimum Spanning Tree**
	a subset of the graph's edges that connect all vertices in the graph together with the minimum sum of edge weights 
	graph must be weighted and connected 
	**Connected**
		graph contains a path between every pair of vertices 

### Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm
Determines the subset of a graph's edges that connect all the graph's vertices with the minimum possible sum of edge weights 
Uses three collections: 
1. edgeQueue
	priority queue of edges, initally containing all graph edges. Edge weights are priorities 
2. result
	a collection of edges comprising the minimum spanning tree, initially empty 
3. vertexSets
	a collection of vertex sets 
	each set represents vertices connected by edges in result 
	Initially, vertexSets contains of set for each vertex
