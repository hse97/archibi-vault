**Graph**
	data structure representing connections among items and consists of vertices connected by edges 
	**Vertex**
		or node, represents an item in a graph
	**Edge**
		represents connection b/t two vertices 

### Adjacency and Path 
In a graph: 
**Adjacent**
	if two vertices are connected by an edge
**Path**
	a sequence of edges leading from a source (starting) vertex to a destination vertex
	**Path Length**
		number of edges in a path
**Distance**
	between two vertices is the number of edges on the shortest path between the two vertices
