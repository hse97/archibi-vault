**Weighted Graphs**
	associates a weight with each edge
	an edge's weight, or cost, represents some numerical value between vertex items, such as flight cost/connection speed/travel time/etc 
	may be directed or undirected 

### Path Length in weighted graphs 
**Path Length**
	is the sum of the edge weights in the path 

### Negative Edge Weight Cycles
**Cycle Length**
	sum of edge weights in a cycle 
**Negative Edge Weight Cycle**
	has a cycle length less than 0 
	a shortest path DNE in a graph w/ negative edge weight cycle because each cycle decreases the length so no minimum exists
