### Graph Traversal and Breadth-First Search
**Graph Traversal**
	an algo to visit every vertex in a graph in some known order 
**Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
	a traversal that visits a starting vertex, then all vertices of distance 1 from vertex, then 2, and so on without revisiting a vertex 

When BFS algo first encounters a vertex, vertex is said to be **discovered**
Vertices in the queue are called the **frontier**, thus discovered but not visited
