Finds the shortest path from a starting vertex between vertices in a graph 
For each vertex, the algo determines the vertex's distance and predecessor's pointer 
**Distance**
	shortest path distance from the start vertext
**Predecessor Pointer**
	points to previous vertex along the shortest path from the start vertex 

The algo initializes all vertexes distances to infinity and inits all predecessors to null
Then enques all vertices into a queue of unvisted vertices 
The algo assigns the start vertex's distance with 0 
While the queue is not empty, the algo dequeues the vertex with the shortest distance
For each adjacent vertex, the algo computes the distance of the path from the start vertex to the current vertex and continuing on to the adjacent vertex 
If the path distance at a new vertex is found to be shorter than the adjacent vertex's current distance, a shorter path has been found 
the adjacent vertext current distance is updated to the distance of the newly found shorter path's distance, and vertex's predecessor pointer is pointed to the current vertex 

Algo can work on graphs with negative weighted edges but will not always work
