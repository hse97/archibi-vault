### Adjacency Lists
represents a graph data structure 
each vertex has a list of adjacent vertices, each list item representing an edge

### Advantages/Disadvantages
key advantage is O(V + E), because each vertex appears once, and each edge appears twice 
	V refers to # of vertices, E # of edges

disadvantage is that determining whether two vertices are adjacent is O(V) because one vertex's adjancy list must be traversed looking for the other vertext and that list oculd have V items 
	however in most implementations, vertexes are only connected to a trivial few other vertexes 
**Sparse Graph**
	has far fewer edges than maximum possible 
	many graphs are sparse
