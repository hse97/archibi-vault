**Adjacency Matrix**
	each vertex assigned to a row and column and a matrix element is 1 if an edge exists, and 0 if not

### Advantage/Disadvantages 
assuming the common implementation of a 2d array whose elements are accessible in O(1), then an adjacency matrix's key benefit is O(1) determination of whether two vertices are adjacent -> corresponding element is just checked for 0 or 1 

Key drawback is O(V^2) size 
	graph with 1000 vertices would be 1000 x 1000 or 1,000,000 elements 
	inefficient for a sparse graph 

matrix only represents edges not data, if each vertex has data then a separate list of vertices is needed
