**Directed Graph or Digraph**
	consists of vertices connected by directed edges 
**Directed Edge**
	a connection between a starting vertex and a terminating vertext 
**Adjacency**
	slightly different than other graphs
	a vertex is adjacent to their starting vertex, but not the other way around
	A -> B means B is adjacent to A, but A is not adjacent to B

### Paths and Cycles
**Path**
	a sequence of directed edges leading from a source (starting) vertex to a destination vertex 
**Cycle**
	a path that starts and ends at the same vertex 
	**Cyclic**
		a digraph is cyclic if the graph contains a cycle
	**Acyclic**
		digraph is acyclic if does not contain a graph 
	graphs can have more than 1 cycle
