	a linked list where the tail node's next pointer poitns to the head of the list instead of null 
	can be used to represent repeating processes 
	head of the circular linked list is often referred to as the start node 
	traversal similar to a normal linked list, but must terminate after reaching the head node twice as opposed to terminating when reaching null 
	can be doubly linked, where the tail points to the previous node and loops back to the tail
