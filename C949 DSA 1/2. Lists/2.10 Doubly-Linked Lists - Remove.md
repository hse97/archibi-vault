	Successor Exists: 
		if sucNode ptr is not null, the algo points the sucNode's prev ptr to the predNode
	Predecessor exists: 
		if predNode ptr is not null, algo points predNode next ptr to the sucNode
	Removing List's head node: 
		if curNode points to the list's head node, the algo points the list's head ptr to the sucNode
