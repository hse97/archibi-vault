**InsertAfter**
	inserts a new node after a provided existing list node 
	curNode is a pointer to an existing list node, but can be null when inserting into an empty list 
	Three Insert Scenarios:
		Insert as List's First Node: 
			If list's head poitner is null, the algo points the list's head and tail pointers to the new node
		Insesrt After Lists's Tail Node: 
			if the list head pointer is not null, and curNode points to tail node, the algo points the tail node's next pointer and the lists's tail pointer to the new node 
		Insert in Middle of List 
			if head ptner not null, and curNode not tail node, the algo points the new node next pointer to curNode's next node and points curNode's pointer to the new node
