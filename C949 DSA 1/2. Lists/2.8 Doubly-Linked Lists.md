**Doubly-Linked List**
	data structure for implementing a list ADT, where each node has data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node 
	structure typically points to the first node and the last node
	The doubly-linked lists's first node is called the head, and the last node the tail 
	called doubly-linked because of the two pointers 
	type of **Positional List**
		a list where elements contain pointers to the next/previous elements in the list

### Appending a node to a doubly-linked list 
**Append**
	inserts the new node after the list's tail node 
	behaves differently in empty v.s non-empty list 
	Empty LIst: 
		if head pointer is null (empty), algo points the list head and tail pointers to the new node
	Non-Empty:
		if head ptr is not null (not empty), algo points the tail node next ptr to the new node, points the new node's previous pointer to the list's tail node, and points the tail pointer to the new node 

### Prepend a node to a doubly-linked list 
**Prepend**
	inserts a new node before the list's head node and points the head pointer to the new node 
	Empty List: 
		if head pointer null, algo points the list head and tail pointers to new node
	Non-Empty: 
		if head ptr not null, algo points new node's next pointer to the list head pointer, points list head node's previous ptr to the new node, and then points the list h ead pointer to the new node
