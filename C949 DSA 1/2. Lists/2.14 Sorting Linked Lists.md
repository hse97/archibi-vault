### Insertion Sort for doubly-linked lists 
starts with second list element, each element in linked list is visited 
each visited element is moved back as needed and inserted into the correct position in the list's sorted portion 
list must be doubly-linked, since backwards traversal not possible in singly-linked lists 

### Insertion Sort for Singly-Linked lists 
changes how each visited element is inserted into the sorted portion of the list 
The standard insertion sort algo traverses the list from current element towards the list head to find the insertion portion
For singly-linked lists the algo finds the insertion pos by traversing the list from head towards current element 
only supports inserting a node after existing list node
ListFindInsertionPosition algo searches the list for the insertion pos and returns the list node after which the current node should be inserted 
If the current node should be inserted at the head, ListFindInsertionPosition returns null
