**List Traversal**
	algo that visits all nodes in the list once and performs an operation on each node
	common traversal operation prints all list nodes
	algo starts by pointing a curNode ptr to the list head node
	while curNode is not null, the algo prints the current node, and then points curNode to the next node 
	After the list's tail node is visited, curNode is poitned to the tail node's next node, which DNE so curNode is null, and traversal ends
	supports singly and doubly linked lists 

**Reverse Traversal**
	visits all nodes starting with tail node and ending after visiting head node
	cannot be used on singly-linked lists, as there are no prev ptrs to traverse backwards through
