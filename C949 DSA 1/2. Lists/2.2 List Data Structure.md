Common approach for implementing a linked list is using two data structures: 
1. **Linked Data Structure**
	a data structure containing the list's head and tail, and may also include addtl info such as list's size
2. List Node Structure
	maintains the data for each list element, including the element's data and pointers to the other list elements 

not required to implement a linked list 
offers convenient way to store the list's head and tail
functions that operate on a list can use a single parameter for the list's data structure to manage the list 
A linked list can also be implemented without using a list data structure, which minimally requires using separate list node pointer variables to keep track of the list's head
