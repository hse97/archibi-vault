**Array-Based Lists**
	ADT implemented using an array 
	supports common list ADT operations such as append, prepend, insert after, remove, and search 
	many languages arrays are fixed sized
	array-based lists dynamically allocate the array as needed as the number of elements changes 
	Initially uses length variable to track how many array elements are in use
	default allocation size greater or equal to 1. Commonly 1 to 10. 
	**Length** = how many elements are in the array-based list
	**Allocation size** = how large the array-based list can potentially be

**Append**
	for array-based list of Length X inserts the new element at end of list or at index X

**Resize Operation**
	array-based list must be resized if an item is added when allocation size equals the list length 
	A new array is allocated with a length > than existing array 
	commonly allocates new array twice the current length 
	existing array elements are copied to the new array which becomes the list storage array 
	has runtime complexity of O(N) as list must be copied 1 to 1 

### **Prepend and insert after operations**
**Prepend**
	inserts new item at start of list 
	if allocation size == list length, array is resized
	all existing elements are moved up 1 position in the array and new item is inserted at list start or index 0
	runtime col of O(N)
**InsertAfter**
	inserts new item after specified index
		 ex: if List [5,8,2] ArrayListInsertAfter(list, 1, 7) List becomes [5,7,8,2] as it inserts the 7 after index 1 
	if allocation size == list length, array is reswized
	after resizing, all elements copied over
	new item is inserted at specified index + 1 in the lists's array 
	best case complexity O(1) worst case col O(N)'

### Search and Removal Operations
**Search**
	returns the index for the first element whose data matches key
		returns -1 if not found
**Remove-At** 
	removes the item at that index
	when removing item, each item after index X is moved down by 1 position

both have worst case col O(N)
