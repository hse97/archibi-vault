**Insert After**
	inserts new node after a provided existing list node 
	curNode is a pointer to an existing list node
	Considers 3 insert scenarios:
		Insert as first node
			if list head ptr is null, algo points the list head and tail ptrs to the new node
		Insert after list tail node
			if head ptr is not null, and curNode points to the lists tail node, the new node is inserted after the tail node
			algo points tail nodes next ptr to the new node, points the new nodes previous ptr to the list tail node, and points the list tail ptr to the new node
		Insert in middle list 
			if list head ptr not null, and curNode does not point to tail node, algo updates the current, new, and sucessor nodes next/prev ptrs to achieve the ordering {curNode, newNode, sucNode}
			requires 4 ptr updates
			point new nodes next ptr to sucNode, point new node's prev ptr to curNode, point curNode next ptr to new node, point sucNode prev ptr to the new node
