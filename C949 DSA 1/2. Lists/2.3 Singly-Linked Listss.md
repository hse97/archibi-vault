**Singly-Linked List**
	data structure for implementing a list ADT where each node has data and a pointer to the next node
	The list structure typically has pointers to the lists's first node and last node 
	A singly linked list's first node is called the **head** and the last node the **tail**
	A singly-linked list is a type of **positional list**: a list where elements contain pointers to the next and/or previous elements in the list 

**Null**
	special value indicating a pointer points to nothing 

### Appending a node to a singly-linked list 
**Append** 
	operation for a singly-linked list inserts the new node after the lists's tail node 
	behaves differently if the list is empty versus not empty 
		To empty list: head and tail pointers point to new node 
		To non-empty list: tail pointer point to new node, old tail node's pointer points to new node 

### Prepending a node to a singly-linked list 
**Prepend**
	operation for singly-linked list 
	inserts the new node before the list's head node 
	behaves differently for empty v.s non-empty lists 
		Empty list: points the lists's head and tail pointers to the new node
		Non-Empty List: points the new node's next pointer to the old head node, and points the list's head node to the new node
