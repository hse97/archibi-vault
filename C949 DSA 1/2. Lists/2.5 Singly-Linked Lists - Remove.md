**RemoveAfter**
	removes the node after specified list node 
	existing node must be specified because each node in a singly-linked list only maintains a pointer to the next node 

The existing node is specified with the curNode paramter. If curNode is null, RemoveAfter removes the list's first node. 
Otherwise, algo removes the node after curNode

*Removes List's Head Node (special case)*
	if curNode is null, algo points sucNode to the head node's next node, and points the lists's head pointer to sucNode. 
	If sucNode is null, the only list node was removed, so the lists's tail pointer is pointed to null (indicating the list is now empty)
*Remove node after curNode*
	If curNode's next pointer is not null (a node after curNode exists), the algo points sucNode to the node after curNode's next node. Then curNode's next pointer is pointed to sucNode. If sucNode is null, the list's tail node was removed, so the algo points the list's tail pointer to curNode (the new tail node)
