### Forward Traversal 
Forward Traversal through a linked list can be implemented using a recursive function that takes a node as an argument. 
If non-null, the node is visited first. Then, recursive call is made on node's next pointer, to traverse the remainder of the list. 
The **ListTraverse** function takes a list as an argument, and searches the entire list by calling **ListTraverseRecursive** on the list's head

### Searching
search is implemented similar to forward traversal 
Each call examines 1 node. If node is null, then null is returned. Otherwise, node's data is compared to the search key. If match occurs, the node is returned. Otherwise, the remainder of the list is searched recursively. 

### Reverse Traversal 
Forward traversal visits a node first, then recursively traverses the remainder of the list 
If the order is swapped, i.e recursive call made first, the list is traversed in the reverse order
