**Dummy Nodes/Header Node**
	a node with an unused data member that always resides at the head of the list and cannot be removed 
	simplifies the algo for a linked list because the head and tail pointers are never null 
	empty list consists of dummy node, which has the next ptr set to null, and the list's head/tail ptr point to the dummy node 
	non-empty lists have the head ptr point to the dummyNode, and the dummy node's next pointer points at the first real node

### Singly-Linked list implementation 
operations such as append, prepend, insert after, and remove after are simpler to implement as it removes the special case for header being null in each case
Append, Prepend, and Insert after do not need to check if list's head is null since it will always be a dummy node
ListRemoveAFter does not need special case to allow remove of first list item, since first item is after dummy node

### Dummy head and tail nodes
doubly-linked list can use 2 dummy nodes: 1 head and 1 tail 
removes addtl conditionals and further simplifies the implementation of most methods
