**Resize**
	operation increases the number of buckets while preserving all existing items 
	hash table with N buckets is commonly resized to the next prime number >= N * 2
	a new array is allocated, and all items from old array are reinserted to the new array, making the resize operation's time complexity O(N)
	uses the standard hash/double hash procedure to remap the elements to the new buckets 

### When to Resize
**Load Factor**
	number of items in the hash table divided by the number of buckets 
		Ex: hash table with 18 items and 31 buckets has load factor of 18/31 = 0.58
	an implementation may choose to resize when one or more of the following values exceeds a certain threshold 
		* load factor
		* # of collisions during an insertion
		* size of buckets in a linked list when using chaining
