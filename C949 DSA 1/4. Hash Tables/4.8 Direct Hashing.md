### Overview
**Direct Hashing Function**
	uses the item's key as the bucket index 
		ex: key = 937, index is 937
	hash table with direct hash function is called **direct access table**
	Given a key, a direct access toable **search** algorithm returns the item at index key if the bucket is not empty, and returns null if empty 

### Limitation of Direct Hashing
Direct access table has advantage of no collisions, each key is unique, and gets a unique bucket so no collision can occur 
However, a direct access table has two main limitations
1. All keys must be non-neg integers, but for some application keys may be negative 
2. hash table size equals the largest key value plus 1, which may be very large
