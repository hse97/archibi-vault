### Cryptography 
field of study focused on transmitting data securely 
secure data transmission commonly starts with **encryption**
	alteration of data to hide original meaning
**Decryption**
	reconstruction of original data from encrypted data 

### Hashing function for data 
hash function can be used to produce a hash value for data in contexts other than inserting the data into a hash table 
hash functions can verify the data integerity by checking the make sure the hash is the same pre-encryption as it is after decryption 
	ex. MD5

### Cryptographic Hashing 
**Cryptographic hash function**
	a hash function designed specifically for cryptography 
	such a function is commonly used for encrypting and decrypting the data 
**Password Hashing Function**
	is a cryptographic hashing function that produces a hash value for a password 
	dB for online services commonly store a user's password hash as opposed to the actual password
	When user attempts a login, the supplied password is hashed, and the hash is compared against the database's hash value 
	because passes are not stored, if dB w/ password hash is breached, attackers may still have a difficult time determining a user's password
