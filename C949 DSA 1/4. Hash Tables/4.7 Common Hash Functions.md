### Good Hash Functions Minimize Collisions 
hash table is fast if the hash func minimizes collisions 
**Perfect Hash Fucntion**
	maps items to buckets with no collisions 
	can only be created if the # of items and all possible item keys are known beforehand 
	runtime for insert, search, remove is O(1) with perfect hash function 

A good hash function should uniformly distribute items into buckets 
w/ chaining, a good h ash function results in short bucket lists and thus fast inserts, searches, and removes 
w/ linear probing, a good hash function will avoid hashing multiple items to consecutive buckets and thus minimize the average linear probing length to achieve fast inserts, searches, removes
On average, a good hash function will achieve O(1) inserts, searches, and removes but in worse-case may be O(N)
a hash function's performance depends on the hash table size and knowledge of expected keys
Ex: the hash function key % 10 will perform poorly if the expected keys are all multiples of 10, because inserting 10,20,30,...,90 and 100 will all collide at bucket 0

### Modulo Hash Function 
uses remainder from the division of the key by the hash table size N 

### Mid-Square Hash Function 
squares the key, extracts R digits from the result's middle, and returns the remainder of the middle digits divided by the table size N 
	ex: hash table with 100 entries, and a key of 453, the decimal (base 10) mid square hash function computes 453 * 453 = 205209 and returns themiddle two digits 52
	For N buckets, R must be >= Ceiling_Function(Log_10(N)) to index all buckets 
	process of squaring and extracting middle digits reduces the likelihood of keys mapping to just a few buckets 

### Mid-Square Hash Function Base 2 Implementation 
mid-square usually uses binary not decimal becuase binary is faster 
decimal implementation requires converting the square of the key to a string, extracting a substring for the middle digits, and converting substring back to an integer
binary implementation only requires a few shift and bitwise AND operations
binary mid-squre hash function extracts middle R bits, and returns remainder of middle bits divided by hash table size N, where R is greater than or equal to ceiling_function(log_2 N)
	Ex: N = 200, R = 8, 8 bits are needed for indices for 0 to 199 

### Multiplicative String Hash Function 
repeatedly multiples the hash value and adds the ASCII (or unicode) value of each character in the string 
multiplicative hash function for strings start with a large initial value 
for each character, the hash function multiplies the current hash value by a multiplier (often prime), and adds the character's value 
Finally, the function returns the remainder of the sum divided by the hash table size N
