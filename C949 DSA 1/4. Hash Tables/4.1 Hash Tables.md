### Overview 
**Hash Table**
	data structure that stores unordered items by mapping (or hashing) each item to a location in an array (or vector)
		Ex. Given an array with indicies 0..9, to store integers from 9...500 the modulo operator can be used to map 25 to index 5 (25 % 10 = 5) and 149 to index 9 (149 % 10 = 9)
	Hash tables main advantage is that searching (or inserting/removing) an item may require only O(1), in contrast to O(N) for searching a list or to O(log N) for binary search 
	an items **Key** is the value used to map an index 
	For all items stored in hash table, each key is ideally unique, so that the hash table's algorithm can search for a specific item by that key 
	Each hash table array element is called a **bucket**. A **hash function** computes a bucket index from the items' key 

### Hash Table Operations
common hash function uses the **modulo operator %** 
	computes remainder when div two numbers 
insert/remove/search each use the hash function to determine an item's bucket
	ex inserting 113 first determines the bucket to be 113 % 10 = 3

### Empty Cells
approach for hash table algo determining whether a cell is empty depends on implementation 
If simply non-neg inteegers, cells can be represented with -1
Items that are objects with multiple fields (age, name, etc) in which case each hash table array element may be a pointer that represents null 

### Collisions 
**Collision**
	occurs when an item is being inserted into a hash table maps to the same bucket as an existing item in the hash table 
		Ex. key % 10, 55 would be in bucket 5, but 75 would also be in bucket 5
	Various techniques to handle collisions during insertions exist 
**Chaining**
	collision resolution technique where each bucket has a list of items
		ex. bucket 5s would be a list that contains 55, 75
**Open Addressing**
	collision resolution technique where collisions are resolved by looking for an empty bucket elsewhere in the table 
		i.e 75 might be stored in bucket 6
