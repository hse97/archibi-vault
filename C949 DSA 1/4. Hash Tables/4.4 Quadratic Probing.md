### Overview and Insertion 
**Quadratic Probing**
	handles collisions by starting at key's mapped bucket, then quadratically searches subsequent buckets until an empty bucket is found
	if item mapped bucket is H, the formula `(H + c1 * i + c2 * i^2) mod (tablesize)` is used to determine the item's index in the hash table 
		c1 and c2 are programmer defined constants for quadratic probing 
	inserting a key uses the formula, starting with i = 0, to repeatedly search the hash table until an empty bucket is found 
	each time an empty bucket is not found, i is incremented by 1
	**Probing Sequence**
		iterates through sequential i values to obtain the desired table index

h = 1, c1 = 1, c2 = 1
i = 0
1 mod 11 = 1
i = 1
3 mod 11 = 3 
i = 2
7 mod 11 = 7
