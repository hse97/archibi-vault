### Overview 
**Linear Probing**
	handles collision by starting the key's mapped bucket, then linearly searches subsequent buckets until an empty bucket is found 
		i.e rather than using a list at every bucket, only one item exists in each bucket, and if already occupied the next available empty bucket is used 
	if searching for an item that DNE, starts at bucket that it should be if no other elements exist, and linearly searches subsequent buckets until finds empty bucket at which returns null 
	when inserting in an array, if at end of hash table, loop back around until empty bucket is found 

### Empty Bucket Types 
linear probing distinguishes two types of empty buckets
**Empty-Since-Start**
	bucket has been empty since hash table was created 
**Empty-After-Removal**
	bucket had item removed that causes the bucket to now be empty 
Distinction important during searches, since searching only stops for empty-since-start, not for empty-after-removal 

### Inserts using linear probing 
the insert algo uses the item's key top determine the initial bucket, linearly probes each bucket, and isnerts the item in the next empty bucket (empty kind doesn't matter here)
If probing reaching last bucket, probing continues at bucket 0
Insert returns true if item was inserted, and false if all buckets are occupied 

### Removals using linear probing 
remove algo uses sought item's key to determine initial bucket
algo probes each bucket until either matching item is found, an empty-since-start bucket is found, or all buckets have been probed
if the item is found, the item is removed, and the bucket is marked empty-after-removal 
	if the algo encounters an empty-after-removal bucket, the algo keeps probing because sought item might have been placed in subsequent bucket before this bucket's item was removed 

### Searching using linear probing
search algo uses sought items key to determine initial bucket
algo probes each bucket until either the matching item is found (returning the item), an empty-since-start bucket is found (returning null), or all buckets probed w/o match (returns null)
if empty-after-removal bucket is found, the search algo continues to probe the next bucket
