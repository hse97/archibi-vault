Ancestor to the ArrayList it's more primitive of a data type literally 
values in an array are called elements 

creating an array. 2 different ways 
	first method: you explicitly define the size upon creating 
		`int[] numbers = new int[3];`
	array is declare by adding square brackets after the type of elements it contains
		`String[] strings = new String[5];` creates a string array that holds 5 strings
	this is really fucking stupid so 
		`int[] numbers = new int[3]` creates a new integer array that can hold 3 ints
		`number[0]` is the first element in the array 
		`number[2]` is the third element in the array 
		confusing as fuck, when defining it you set it to the size 
		when using it you index from 0 so (size-1)
