4th day of WGU. Going to try and keep track of what I learn on a daily basis and general thoughts. 

Currently working on D276 Fundamentals of Web Programming. 

No experience going into this so I don't know what to expect. A lot of people on the subreddit have said the Zybook is useless for this course but I'm going to work through it to make sure I at least get the fundamentals. 

It seems to be covering a lot of ground but going very light on the details. I don't know if that is a good or a bad thing. I have heard the OA is much harder then the PA so I'm nervous about that. 
## Overview 
### [[3.3 Common Form Widgets]]

Form widgets are things that take user input and pass them through an `<form>` container
```
<form action="https://wp.zybooks.com/form-viewer.php" target="_blank" method="GET">
```

Some of the most common ones used:
##### Checkbox
Input widget, selection menu that lets you choose multiple options 
`<input type="checkbox">`

##### Radio Button 
input widget, selection menu that only lets you choose one option 
`<input type="radio">`

##### Drop Down Menu
lets users select from a drop down menu
`<select name="DropDownMenu">`
	`<option value="football">Football</option>`
`</select>`

##### List Box
drop down menu of predetermined size
`<select size="4" name="ListBox">`
	`<option value="red">Red</option>`
`</select>`

##### Button 
user interactable button 
`<input type="button">`
	`typer="submit"` is common too 

##### Password Field
Hides user input text on screen
`<input typer="password">`

##### Fieldset
container element that groups widgets together and draws a box around them 
`<fieldset>`
	`<legend>The Caption</legend
	`<input type="radio" name="sitcom" value="The Office" id="theOffice">
 `` <label for="theOffice">The Office</label>


### [[3.4 Additional Form Widgets]]

Some form widgets are are more specific then just text or selection. 

##### Date picker 
Brings up a calendar for a user to graphically select a date 
`<input type="date">`

##### Color Picker
allows users to select from a color wheel/pallete 
`<input typer="color">`

##### Number Input 
textfield that only allows integer input 
`<input typer="number"`

##### Range Input
Slider that user can graphically edit to enter a value
`<input type="range">`

##### Combo Box
Combines a text field and a drop down menu. Allows user to type into text field and it shows predicted options in drop down menu 
```
<input list="sport">
<datalist id="sport">
	<option value="Baseball">
</datalist>
```

##### Form Validation 

| Attribute | Description                                                                 | Example                                                                                                    |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| maxlength | Sets the maximum number of input characters.                                | `<!-- Only 4 chars max can be entered -->`<br>`<input type="password" maxlength="4">`                      |
| minlength | Sets the minimum number of input characters.                                | `<!-- At least 5 chars must be entered -->`<br>`<input type="password" minlength="5">`                     |
| max       | Sets the maximum value that the input can have.                             | `<!-- Number may not exceed 212 -->`<br>`<input type="number" max="212">`                                  |

| step      | Sets the amount by which the value can change (default is 1).               | `<!-- Number is changed by multiples of 5 -->`<br>`<input type="range" step="5">`                          |

### [[3.5 Audio and Video]]

`<audio>` plays an audio file on the webpage
	`<source>` is an element declared after `<audio>` with the file's URL

`<video>` plays a video file on the webpage
	`<source>` declared after `<video>` points to the file's URL 

##### Youtube Videos
`<iframe>` element embeds a webpage within a webpage 
	`src` attribute to point to URL 
	`width` and `height` attributes to specify size

### [[3.6 <script> and <style>]]

`<script>` element allows webpage to include executable code
	assumes JS unless noted otherwise with the `type` attribute

`<style>` element allows CSS directly in an HTML file 
	placed in the HTML's `<head>` container

### [[3.7 HTML Developer Guidelines]]
* Use Closing tags
* Avoid self-closing tags
	i.e `<br />` 
* Use quotes for Attribute values
* use double quotes
* Use boolean attributes concisely
* start block elements on new line
	i.e `<p> <table> or <ol>`
* Indent nested elements consistently 
* Separate content from presentation and functionality 
* Use CSS for Layout
* Validate HTML 

### [[4.1 Intro to XML]]
XML is a markup language that is used to structure data 
Not necessarily meant to be displayed
Can create your own tags in XML not limited to predefined tags like HTML 
XML Tags follow 1 of 2 formats 
	Element tags:
		`<city>"LA"</city>`
	Self-closing tags:
		`<hierarchy title="United States"/>`

### [[5.1 Using CSS in HTML]]
CSS has Selectors and Declarations
##### Applying CSS 
1. inline - directly in the `style` attribute of an element
2. embedded, CSS directly in the `<head>` using `<style>`
3. External style sheet, uses `<link href="URL" rel="stylesheet">`
##### Inheritance and Conflict
Inheritance
	style cascades down from parent to child, children inherit parent styles
Conflict
	if styles conflict, chooses the most specific declaration, i.e further nested you go the styling takes priority 

### [[5.2 Basic Selectors]]
##### Element, Class, ID Selectors
Element selector 
	styles based on element type
	`p {color: blue;}`
Class selector
	styles based on class
	`.byClass {color: blue;}`
ID selector
	matches based on ID 
	`#byID {color: blue;}`

Classes
	devs can assign elements to classes 
	`class="myClass secondClass"` attribute 
		can have multiple classes for 1 element

##### Descendant Selector
selects element if it's a descendant 
	`h2 em {color: blue;}`
		all `em` elements that are children of a `h2` element will be styled

##### Pseudo-Class  Selector
matches elements based on user behavior or metainformation 
uses `:` to specify 
	`a:hover {color: blue;}
		Anchor element would become blue when user hovers over it

### [[5.3 Advanced Selectors]]

##### Universal Selector
selects all elements in the HTML 
`*` 
##### Multiple Selectors
can put multiple elements on the same line 
`ul, ol {color: blue;}`
	makes both `ul` and `ol` elements blue

##### Child Selectors
match elements that are direct descendants of an element
`p > em {color: blue;}`
	all `em` elements that are direct children of any `p` element will be blue
##### Sibling Selectors
General Sibling Selector
	matches elements that have the same parent, but don't need to be directly next to each other 
	`p ~ em {color: white;}`

Adjacent Sibling Selector
	matches elements that have same parent and are directly next to each other 
	`h1 + p {color: white}`

##### Attribute Selector
matches elements with specific attribute or attribute value
	`a[target="_blank"] {color: blue;}` 
		any anchor elements with a target set to blank would be blue 
##### Pseudo-Element Selector
matches part of the elements 
	`li::after {color: blue;}`
	element after `li` would be blue 

### [[5.4 Common Properties]]
##### Color Property
can style an element by name, RGB value, Hexadecimal, and HSL value
	RGBa and HSLa have alpha values for transparency 
##### Background Properties
background-color
background-image
background
##### Float and Clear Properties
controls how text flows around elements
`float` controls text wrapping around elements like an image
`clear` moves elements below floated elements 
##### Display Property 
`inline` makes the element display as an inline 
`block` displays element as a block 
`none` hides the element
`inline-block` display content as a block, but formatted as an inline
`list-item` displays content as a list item 
##### CSS Variable
custom CSS property that defines a value
declare variable 
	selector with a variable scope
		`:root` for global scope
	`--my--variable: red;`
access variable
	`var(--my--variable)`

### [[5.5 Font and Text Properties]]
##### Font Properties
`font-family`
`font-size`
`font-weight`
`font-style`
`font-variant`
`font`
##### Font Sizes
Predefined sizes 
	`xx-small, x-small, small, medium, large, x-large, xx-large`

Absolute Sizes
	`cm`
	`mm`
	`in`
	`px` - 1px = 1/96"
	`pt` -1pt = 1/72"
	`pc` - 1pc = 12pt

Relative Size
	`em` - relative to font size
		`2em` = 2x current font
	`rem` - relative to root element's font size
		`1.5rem` = 1.5x `<html>` element font size
	`vw` - 1% of the viewport's width
		`1vw` = 1% of the browser's width
	`vh` - 1% of the viewport's height
		`1vh` = 1% of the browsers height
	`%` percentage of element's size
		`120%` = 20% larger element
##### Text Properties
`text-align`
`text-decoration`
`text-transform`
`text-indent`

### [[5.6 Box Model]]
##### Box Model Components 
HTML are just boxes nested in boxes 
	Content 
	Padding 
		always transparent, box around content
	Border
		contains padded content 
		default transparent but can be colored
	Margin
		contains all 3 boxes, transparent
`padding` `border` `margin` 

Render Rules:
- content displayed with background according to element background
- padding transparent unless background color, then same color as background
- border can be colored or transparent, transparent would be same color as background
- margin is transparent, will display using background color of parent element 
##### Box Sizing
`padding` and `margin` can have 4 passed valued 
1 value
	describes every side around box
2 values
	top/bottom and right/left
3 values
	top, right/left, bottom 
4 values
	all sides
##### Content Width and Height
block elements span width of parent element unless changed 
	`width` and `height` attributes
Inline elements cannot change their size unless changed to 
	`inline-block` format 
##### Margin Collapsing and Horizontal Centering
Vertical margins can sometimes combine and collapse into a single vertical space
Horizontal margins never collapse
Resulting Margin Size:
	top element -> bottom margin 
	bottom element -> top margin 
		If the top element's bottom margin is > bottom element's top margin then the top element's bottom margin will be displayed
