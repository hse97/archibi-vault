### Variable Declarations
statement that delcares a new variable 
	`int userAge`

Allocation
	process of determining a suitable memory location to store data like a variable 

### Assignment Statements
assigns the variable on the left side of the = with the current value on the right side
	`numApples = 8;`

Expression
	any line such as `80;` or a variable name like `numApples`

Integer Literal 
	literally an integer

### Initializing Variables 
Not required, but common to assign an initial value when declared 
	`int maxScore = 100;`

### Assignment statement with same variable on both sides
eg `numItems = numItems + 1`
it would take numItems, add 1, then replace the original numItems with the new +1 value 

### Common Errors
common error is to read a variable that has not yet been assigned a value 
if a variable is declared but not initialized, the variable's memory location contains some unknonw value, commonly but not always 0
unititialized variables may run correctly on a system with a value of 0 at that memory address, but then will fail on another system where that memory address is not equal to 0
