calculations can sometimes be a mix of ints and floats 
**Type Conversions**
	conversion of one data type to another such as int to double 
	compilers automatically do this for common conversions between ints and floats 
		**Implicit Conversion**

For arithmetic operators like + or * if either operand is a double then the result automatically converts 
for assignments, the right side type is converted to the left side type 

Int-To-Double
	25 becomes 25.0
Double-to-Int
	25.9 becomes 25
	does not round just drops

### Type Casting
sometimes need to explicitly convert an item's type 
**Type Cast**
	explicitly converts value of one type to another 
	`static_cast` operator 
		`static_cast<double>(intValue)` would explicitly convert the int to a double
