### Basics
the standard math library has ~20 functions
programmer needs to include the library to use the math functions
	`#include <cmath>`

function 
	list of statements executed when invoked known as a **FUNCTION CALL**
	take **ARGUMENTS** which are just input for the function

### Division: Integer Rounding
When you use the `/` operator on integers it rounds to the nearest whole integer, does not contain decimals 
	`y = 10/4 
		Return: `2` and not `2.5`
if at least one value in the expression is a floating point number, then the entire operation will result in a floating point number 
	`int w = 10;`
	`double x = 4.0;`
	`y = w / x;`
		Return: `2.5`

**Divide-By-Zero**
	runtime error that happens when a program attempts to use `/` or `%` with 0 as the second operand 

### Modulo (%)
evaluates the reminder of the division of two integer operands 
	`23 % 10`
	Returns: `3`
can only be used with integers
cannot have 0 as the second operand
