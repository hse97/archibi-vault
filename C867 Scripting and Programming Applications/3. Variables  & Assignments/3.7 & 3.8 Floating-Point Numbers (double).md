### Floating-point (double) variables
floating-point numbers are real numbers containing a decimal point that can appear anywhere (or "float") in the numbers 

### Manipulating Floaing Point Output
by default most floats output 5 decimals but can be altered
`cout << fixed << setprecision(2) << myFloat;`
only need to be used once and it will apply to all output within the scope

stuff like `M_PI` can be used to represent pi
