Variable 
	named item such as x or numPeople
	used to hold a value
Assignment 
	assigns a variable with a value 
		`x = 5`
	assignment means x is assigned 5 and x kesp the value during subsequent assignments until x is assigned again 

= is not equals
	'x = 5' should read 'x is assigned 5'
	because of this a variable can appear on both left and right side of the '=' sign
		`x = x + 1`
	this is know as **INCREMENTING** the variable
