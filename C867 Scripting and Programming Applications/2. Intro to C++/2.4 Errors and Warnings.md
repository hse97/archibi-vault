### Syntax Errors 
violation in the programs langauge rules on how symbols/letters can be combined to create a program 
	i.e forgetting a semicolon at the end of a statement 

### Unclear error messages
some errors are unclear and the compiler best guesses on what the error is 

If multiple error messages are thrown, good practice is to fix the first error and recompile as that might solve the other, later errors 

### Logic Errors
Compile Time Error
	errors that prevent programs from compiling 
	i.e syntax erros

Logic Error/Bug
	errors in program that compile and occur when program is running
