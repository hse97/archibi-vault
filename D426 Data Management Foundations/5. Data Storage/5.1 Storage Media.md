Four important dimensions: 
**Speed**
	measured as access time and transfer rate
	**Access Time**
		time required to access first byte in read or write operation 
	**Transfer Rate**
		speed at which data is read or written, following initial access 
**Cost**
	typically range from pennies to dollars depends on media type
**Capacity**
	limited by cost, more expensive media types have lower capacity
**Volatility**
	**Volatile Memory**
		Data is lost when disconnected from Power 
	**Non-Volatile Memory**
		data is retained without power 

Three types of media are most important for dB management 
**Main Memory**
	AKA **Random-Access Memory (RAM)**
	primary memory used when computer programs execute 
	fast, expensive, limited capacity 
**Flash memory**
	AKA **Solid-State Drive (SSD)**
	less expensive, higher capacity, slower speed 
**Magnetic Disk**
	AKA **Hard-Disk Drive (HDD)**
	Slower, less expensive, v. high capacity 

Main Memory is Volatile 
Flash and Magnetic Disk are non-volatile and considered storage media 
dB stores data permanently on storage and transfers data to main memory during program execution 

Table 5.1.1: Media characteristics (circa 2018).

|Media type|Access time  <br>(microseconds)|Transfer rate  <br>(gigabyte/second)|Cost  <br>($/gigabyte)|Volatile|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Main memory|.01 to .1|> 10|> 1|Yes|
|Flash memory|20 to 100|.5 to 3|around .25|No|
|Magnetic disk|5,000 to 10,000|.05 to .2|around .02|No|
### Sectors, Pages, and Blocks 
HDD group data in **sectors**
	usually 512 bytes per sector, but 4kb with newer formats 
Flash stores data in **pages**
	usually 2-16kb per page 

Database file systems use a uniform size called a **block** when transferring data between main memory and storage media 
	independent of storage media 
	storage media are managed by controllers, they convert between blocks and sectors or pages 

Block size must be uniform within a database, but in most dB systems, can be specified by the database admin 
	typically 2-64kb 
	smaller blocks are better for transactional applications
	larger block sizes are better for analytic applications, more size = more rows 

### Row-Oriented Storage 
Accessing storage media is relatively slow 
Data is transferred to and from storage media in block, dBs attempt to minimize the number of blocks required for common queries 

most relational dBs are optimized for transactional applications 
	often read and write individual rows
To minimize block transfers, relational dBs usually store entire row within one block 
	this is called **Row-Oriented Storage**

Row-Oriented storage performs best when row size is small relative to block size, for two reasons: 
**Imrpoved Query Performance**
**Less Wasted Storage**

Sometimes a table contains a very large column, such as 1 megabyte documents or 10 megabyte images. For tables with large columns, each row usually contains a link to the large column, which is stored in a different area. The large column might be stored in files managed by the operating system or in a special storage area managed by the database. This approach keeps row size small and improves performance of queries that do not access the large column.

### Column Oriented Storage 
Some newer dBs are optimized for analytic applications rather then transactional applications 
Analytical applications often read few columns for many rows 
	column-oriented storage is better for this 
Several benefits:
**Faster Data Access**
**Better Data Compression**
