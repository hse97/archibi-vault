**Single-Level Index**
	file containing col vals and pointers to rows containing the column vals
	pointer identifies the block containing the row 
		Some indexes identify the exact location for the row within the block 
	Indexes are created by database designers with CREATE INDEX command 

Single level indexes are normally sorted on the column value 
Stored index is not the same as an index on a sorted table 

If an Indexed column is unique, the index has one entry for each column value. 
	If indexed column is not unique, the index may have multiple entries for some column values or one entry for each column value, followed by multiple pointers 

An index is usually defined on a single column, but an index can be defined on multiple columns. 

### Query Processing 
To execute a SELECT query, the dB can perform a table scan or an index scan: 
**Table Scan**
	dB operation that reads table blocks directly, without accessing an index 
**Index Scan**
	dB operation that reads index blocks sequentially, in order to locate the needed table blocks 

**Hit Ratio**
	AKA **Filter Factor** or **Selectivity**
	percentage of table rows selected by a query 
	When SELECT query is executed, dB examines WHERE clause and estimates Hit Ratio
		if Hit Ratio Est. is high -> table scan
		If Hit Ratio Est. is low a table scan would be inefficient. Instead the dB: 
			1. Looks for Indexed columns in the WHERE clause 
			2. Scans the index 
			3. Finds the value that match the WHERE clause 
			4. Reads the corresponding table blocks 
If the WHERE clause does not contain an indexed column, the dB must perform a table scan 

Since a column value and pointer occupy less space than an entire row, an index requires fewer blocks than a table. Consequently, index scans are much faster then table scans 

### Binary Search 
Index scans are faster then table scans, still not fast enough 

**Binary Search**
	Split the index in two until it finds the entry containing search value 
1. dB compares search value to middle index value
2. if search val < middle index val, searches first half of index. If not, search second half of index. 
3. dB now compares search value to the entry in the middle of the selected half and narrows it down to a quarter of the index
4. Repeats until search value is found 

For an index of N blocks binary search reads Log_2(N) so it's logarithmicly fast 

### Primary and Secondary Indexes
Indexes on sorted tables may be primary or secondary 
**Primary Index**
	AKA clustering index
	Index on the sort column
**Secondary Index**
	AKA non-clustering index
	Index not on the sort column 

Sorted tables can only have one sort column, therefore only one primary index 
	usually primary index is on primary key column(s)
in some dB systems, primary index may be created on any column 
Tables can have many secondary indexes 

Indexes may also be dense or sparse: 
**Dense Index**
	contains entry for every table row
**Sparse Index**
	contains an entry for every table block 

Primary index on sort columns are usually sparse 
Secondary indexes are on non-sort columns are are therefore always dense

Primary indexes are usually sparse and sparse are faster, database designers usually create a primary index on the primary key of large tables

###  Inserts, Updates, and Deletes 
All have impact on single-level indexes 

Insert
	new index entry is created when a row is inserted into a table 
	single-level indexes are sorted, new entry must be places in the correct index block 
	If block full, block splits in two to create space for new index entry 

Delete
	row index must be deleted either physically or marked 'deleted'
	physically deleted you must move all other blocks which is slow

Update 
	does not effect the index 
	update acts like a delete and then an insert in the same index level
