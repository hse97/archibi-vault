### MySQL Storage Engines
**Logical Design**
	specifies tables, columns, and keys 

**Physical Design**
	specifies indexes, table structures, and partitions 
	affects query performance but never query results 

**Storage Engine/Storage Manager**
	translates instructions generated by a query processor into low-level commands that access data on storage devices 
	different engines support different index and table structures so physical design depends on specific storage engine 

MySQL can be configured with some including: 
**InnoDB**
	default storage engine installed with MySQL 
	full support for transaction management, foreign keys, referential integrity, and locking
**MyISAM**
	limited transaction management and locking capabilities
	commonly used for analytic applications with limited data updates
**MEMORY**
	stores all data in main memory 
	for fast access and small datasets 

Different databases and storage engines support different table structures and index types 

### CREATE INDEX, DROP INDEX, and SHOW INDEX statements 
In MySQL with InnoDB:
- Indexes are always B+Tree indexes
- A primary key is automatically created on every primary key 
- A secondary index is automatically created on every foreign key 
- Addtl secondary indexes are created manually with the CREATE INDEX statement
- Tables with primary key have sorted structure 
- Tables with no primary key have a heap structure 
The CREATE INDEX statement creates an index by specifying the index name and table columns that compose the index. Most indexes specify just one column, but a composite index specifies multiple columns.

The DROP INDEX statement deletes a table's index.

The SHOW INDEX statement displays a table's index. SHOW INDEX generates a result table with one row for each column of each index. A multi-column index has multiple rows in the result table.

table 5.7.1: INDEX statements.

|Statement|Description|Syntax|
|---|---|---|
|CREATE INDEX|Create an index|CREATE INDEX IndexName<br>ON TableName (Column1, Column2, ..., ColumnN);|
|DROP INDEX|Delete an index|DROP INDEX IndexName ON TableName;|
|SHOW INDEX|Show an index|SHOW INDEX FROM TableName;|
