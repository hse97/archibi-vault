stores column values and row pointers in a hierarchy 
bottom level of this hierarchy is a sorted single-level index 
bottom level is sparse for primary indexes 
	dense for secondary indexes

Each level above the bottom is a sparse sorted index to the level below 
Since all levels above the bottom are sparse, levels rapidly become smaller 
	Top level always fits in one block 

To locate a row containing an indexed value, the database first reads the top-level block 

The dB compares indexed value to entries in the block and locates the next level block containing the value 
	continues this pattern until it gets to bottom level block containing value
	bottom-level block contains pointer to the correct table block 

### Number of Levels 
A dense index has more bottom-level entries than a sparse index, and may have more levels. Assuming a table with 10 million rows and 400 index entries per block, a dense index has three levels:

- Level 3 is dense and has 25,000 blocks = 10 million rows / 400 index entries per block
- Level 2 is sparse and has 63 blocks = 25,000 level 3 blocks / 400 index entries per block
- Level 1 is sparse and has one block containing 63 index entries.

**Fan-Out**
	number of index entries per block of a multi-level index 
	number of levels in a multi-level index can be computed from fan-out 
- For a dense index, number of levels = logfan-out (number of rows)
- For a sparse index, number of levels = logfan-out (number of rows / rows per block)
### Query Processing 
Multi-Level indexes are faster than single-level indexes on most queries 
Consider the following scenario 
- table has 10 million rows 
- each row is 100 bytes 
- each index entry is 10 bytes 
- table and index blocks are 4 kilobytes 

### Balanced Indexes
**Branch**
	path from top-level block to bottom-level block 
**Balanced**
	when all branches are the same length 
	**Imbalanced** when not same length 

Imbalanced indexes undesirable due to differing query response times 
inserts are managed to maintain balanced indexes

1. dense index, inserts always generate new bottom-level index entries 
	Sparse indexes, inserts generate new bottom-level index entries when table blocks split 
2. If new index entry goes into a full index block, the blocks splits 
	Half of the rows move to the new block, creating space for the entry 
3. The new block in the bottom level generates a new index entry the next level up 
	If the block in the next level up is full, the block splits and the process repeats 
4. If the blocks are full at all index levels, the split propagates to the top level

### B-Tree and B+Tree
The balanced multi-level index described above is called a B+Tree, derived from an earlier approach called a B-Tree

**B+Tree**
	all indexed values appear in the bottom level 
	pointers to table blocks appear only in the bottom level 
	since some indexed values also appear in higher levels, values are occasionally repeated in the index 
**B-Tree**
	If an indexed value appears in a higher level, the value is not repeated at lower levels. Instead pointers exist in higher levels along with value 

B-Tree are more compact since doesn't repeat values 
B+Tree simpler and easier to understand as all pointers are on same level 
	Bottom level is a single-index and can be scanned or searched
	easier to implement insert, updates, and deletes
