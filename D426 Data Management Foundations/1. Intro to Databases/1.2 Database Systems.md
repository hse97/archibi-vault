### File Systems and Database Systems 
Large databases have special requirements
	Performance
		Many users simultaneously quering a database degrade response time 
		properly structured data decrease response time
	Authorization 
		limits on what data users have access to
	Security
		Ensure authorized users only access data, protect against hackers
	Rules
		Ensure data is consistent with structural and business rules 
	Recovery
		recovery from failures and restore database without loss of data

### Transactions
Transaction management is particularly challenging 
**Transaction**
	Group of queries that must be either completed or rejected as a whole 
		execution of some but not all of the queries results in incorrect data 

When processing transactions:
	Ensure transactions are processed completely or not at all
	Prevent conflicts between concurrent transactions 
	ensure transaction results are never lost 

### Architecture 
describes internal components and the relationship between those components. At a high level those components are: 
**Query Processor**
	interprets queries, plans on how to execute the query, and returns the response to the application 
		**query optimization** most efficient instructions executed on data
**Storage manager**
	translate query processor instructions into low-level file-system commands that modify or retrieve data 
		uses **Indexes** to quickly locate the data 
**Transaction manager**
	ensures transactions are properly executed, prevents conflicts, returns to consistent state if transaction fails 
**Log**
	complete record of all inserts, updates, and deletes processed 
**Catalog/Data Dictionary**
	directory of tables, columns, indexes, and database objects. Other components use this to find data and execute queries 
	stores **Metadata**

### Products 
**Relational Database**
	most common form of database 
	stores data in tables, columns, rows, similar to a spreadsheet
	all data in a column must be in the same format
	all data in a row represents a single object, such as a person, place, product, or activity 

All relational databases support the SQL query language 
**SQL**
	Structured Query Language 
		includes statements that read, write, create, and delete colums, and administer the database

Newer non-relational systems are called **NoSQL**, but are optimized for big data
