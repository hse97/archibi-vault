### Analysis 
**Database Design**
	specification of database objects such as tables, columns, data types, and indexes
	also refers to the process used to develop the specification 

Process has 3 phases:
1. Analysis
2. Logical Design
3. Physical Design 

**Analysis**
	phase specifies database requirements without regard to a specific database system 
	requirements represented as entities, relationships, and attributes 
		Entity - Person, place, activity, thing, etc // Noun
		Relationship - link between entities // Verb
		Attribute - Descriptive property of an entity // Adjective
Also called: 
	Conceptual Design, entity-relationship modeling, requirements definition 

Entities, relationships, and attributes are depicted in **ER Diagrams**

### Logical Design 
phase that implements database requirements in a specific database system 
**Key**
	column used to identify individual rows of a table
Table, keys, and columns are specified in SQL with `CREATE TABLE` statements 

Depicted in a **table diagram** similar to ER diagrams but more details
![[Pasted image 20240818002943.png]]
- rectangles represent tables 
- text within rectangles represent columns 
- Solid bullets indicate key columns 
- Empty bullets and arrows indicate columns that refer to keys 

### Physical Design 
adds indexes and specifies how tables are organized on storage media
specified with an SQL statement such as `CREATE INDEX`
	specific to database systems

Logical design affects query results 
Physical design affects query processing speed 
**Data Independence**
	principle that physical design never affects query results 
	allows designers to modify databases without affecting end users or programs that query the database
