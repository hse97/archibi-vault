### Implementing Plural Attributes 
In the 'implement entities' step, entities become tables and attributes become columns 
Singular attributes remain in the initial table, but plural attributes move to a new weak table 
- New table contains the plural attribute and a foreign key referencing the initial table 
- The primary key of the new table is the composite of the plural attribute and the foreign key 
- The new table is identified by the initial table, so primary key cascade and foreign key restrict rules are specified 
- The new table name consists of the initial table name followed by the attribute name 
If a plural attribute has a small, fixed maximum, the plural attribute can be implemented as multiple columns in the intial table. However, implementing plural attributes in a new table simpliefies queries and is usually a better solution 

### Implementing Attribute Types 
Each attribute has an attribute type included in the attribute name 
During discovery step, attribute types are selected from a list of standard attribute types in the glossary 

During Logical design, an SQL data type is defined for each attribute type and documented in the glossary 
	when attribute becomes a column, attribute type determines the column data type 

### Implementing Attribute Cardinality 
Attributes can be unique, required, or optional 
- unique attribute instances describe only one entity instance 
- entity instances have at least one required attribute instance 
- entity instances can have zero optional attribute instances but need at least one required attribute instance 

Unique and required attributes are implemented with Keywords following column name in the CREATE TABLE statement 

UNIQUE is specified on columns derived from unique attributes 
NOT NULL is specified on columns derived from required attributes 
PRIMARY KEY specifies for primary key columns 
	automatically enforces unique and required so keywords aren't needed

UNIQUE and NOT NULL are also specified on foreign key columns derived from unique and required relationships 

Optional attributes and relationships become columns with NULLs allowed and do not require special keywords
