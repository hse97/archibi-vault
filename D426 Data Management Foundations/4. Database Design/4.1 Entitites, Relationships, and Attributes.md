### The Entity-Relationship Model 
Database design begins with verbal/written requirements, then formalized as an entity-relationship model, and then implemented with SQL 

**Entity-Relationship Model**
	high-level representation of data requirements, ignoring implementation details
	An entity-relationship model guides implementation in a particular database system such as MySQL 

Includes 3 kinds of objects: 
**Entity**
	a person, place, concept, or activity 
**Relationship**
	a statement about two entities 
**Attribute**
	a descriptive property of an entity 

Relationship is usually about two different entities 
**Reflexive Relationship** relates an entity to itself 


Entities -> Tables 
Relationships -> Foreign Keys 
Attributes -> Columns 

### Entity-Relationship Diagram and Glossary 
**ER Diagram**
	Entity-Relationship Diagram 
	Entities are drawn as rectangles 
	Relationships are drawn as connecting rectangles 
	Attributes appear as optional text, only appear when addtl detail is needed

**Glossary**
	also known as **data dictionary** or **repository**
	documents addtl detail in text form 
	names, synonyms, description of entities, relationships, attributes, etc etc 

### Types And Instances 
**Entity Type**
	a set of things 
		all employees in a company
**Relationship Type**
	set of related things 
		Employee-Manages-Department is a set of pairs 
**Attribute Type**
	set of values 
		All employee salaries 
Entity, relationship, and attribute types usually becomes tables, foreign keys, and columns, respectively 

An instance is an element of a set:
**Entity Instance**
	an individual thing 
		The employee Sam Snead 
**Relationship Instance**
	a statement about an entity instance
		'Maria manages Sales'
**Attribute Instance**
	an individual value 
		Salary: $35,000
Entity, relationship, and attribute instances usually become rows, foreign keys values, and column values, respectively 

### Database Design 
Complex databases are developed in three phases: 
1. Analysis
	develops an entity-relationship model, capturing data requirements while ignoring particular database systems
2. Logical Design
	Converts the entity-relationship model into tables, columns, and keys for a particular database system 
3. Physical 
	Adds indexes and specifies how tables are organized on storage media
