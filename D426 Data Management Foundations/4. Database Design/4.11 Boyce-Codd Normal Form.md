### Redundancy and Dependence 
ColA depends on ColB means that for every B value there is at most one related A value 
ColA and ColB may be simple or composite 
	'A depends on B' denoted with B -> A 
Dependence of one column on another is called functional dependence 
Redundancy occurs when a column depends on another column that is not unique 

In Boyce-Codd normal form tables, all dependencies are on unique columns 
	removes all redundancy arising from functional dependence 

### Third Normal Form 
Informally, a table is in third normal form when all non-key columns depend on the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key! 

**Candidate Key**
	simple of composite column that is unique and minimal 
	**Minimal**
		means all columns are necessary for uniqueness
	A table may have several candidate keys 
		designer designates one candidate key as a primary key 

**non-key** column is a column that is not contained in a candidate key 

a table is in **third normal form** if, whenver a non-key column A depends on Column B, then B is unique 
	ColA and ColB may be simple or composite 
	Although B is unique, B does not need to be minimal therefore it is not necessarily a candidate key 

### Boyce-Codd Normal Form 
The definition of third normal form applies to non-key columns only and allows for occasional redundancy 
Boyce-Codd normal form applies to all columns and eliminates this redundancy 

**Boyce-Codd Normal Form Table**
	whenever Col A depends on Col B, then B is unique
	Col A and B may be simple or composite 
Definition is the same as 3rd normal form just with the term 'non-key' removed 

Considered gold standard for table design
