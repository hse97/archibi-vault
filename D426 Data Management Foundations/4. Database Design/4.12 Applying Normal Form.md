### Normalization 
The last step of logical design 
Eliminates redundancy 

**Normalization**
	eliminates redundancy be decomposing a table into two or more tables in higher normal form 
		a table in first normal form may be replaced by two tables in 3rd order form 

Column A depends on Column B when each B value is related to at most one A value
A and B may be simple or composite columns 
In a Boyce-Codd normal form table, if Column A depends on Column B, then B must be unique 
Normalizing a Boyce-Codd normal form table involves 3 steps: 
1. List all unique columns 
	Unique columns may be simple or composite 
	In composite, remove all columns necessary for uniqueness 
	Primary Key is always unique and therefore should always be on this list 
2. Identify all dependencies on non-unique columns 
	Non unique columns are either **external** to the unique columns or are **contained within** a composite unique column 
3. Eliminate dependencies on non-unique columns 
	If ColA depends on non-unique ColB,  A is removed from the original table 
	a new table is created containing A and B
	B is a primary key in the new table and a foreign key in the original table 
Normalization eliminates redundancy by removing A from the original table 
Since Data relating A and B is recorded in a new table, no info is lost

### Denormalization 
Boyce-Codd is ideal for tables with frequent inserts, updates, and deletes 
some dBs it can be desirable to have redundancy 

**Denormalization**
	means intentionally introducing redundancy by merging tables
	eliminates join queries and therefore improves query performance
