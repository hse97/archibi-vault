### Supertype and Subtype Entities 
An entity type is a set of entity instances 
**Subtype Entity**
	subset of another entity type called **Supertype Entity**
		Managers are a subset of Employees, so Manager is a subtype and Employees is a supertype 
In ER diagrams Subtypes are drawn inside supertypes

Supertype entity identifies its subtype entity 
Identifying relationship is called an IsA relationship
	as in Manager-IsAn-Employee 

### Similar Entities and Optional Attributes 
Supertype and subtype entities are often created from similar entities and optional attributes 

**Similar Entities** 
	entities with many common attributes and relationships
	Similar entities become subtypes of a new supertype entity 
	Common attributes and relationships move to the new supertype entity 
	Attributes and relationships that are not shared remain with the subtype entities

###  Paritions 
**Parition**
	a group of mutually exclusive subtype entities 
	supertypes can have several partitions 
	subtype entities within each partition are disjoint and do not share instances 
	subtype entities in different partitions overlap and do share instances 

In diagrams, subtype entities within each partition are vertically aligned 
subtype entities in different partitions are horizontally aligned 

Each partition corresponds to an optional **partition attribute** of the supertype entity 
the partition attribute indicates which subtype entity is associated with each supertype instance
