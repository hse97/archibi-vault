Entities, relationships, and attributes are discovered in interviews with database users and managers.

In interviews and documents, entities, relationships, and attributes surface as nouns and verbs. 

Entities usually appear as nouns, but not all nouns are entities 
Relationships are often expressed as verbs 
Attributes are usually nouns that denote specific data such as names, dates, quantities, and monetary values 

### Names
Entity names are singular nouns 
	E.g Employee instead of Employees

Relationship names have the form `Entity-Verb-Entity`
