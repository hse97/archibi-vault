### Selecting Primary Keys
In the first step of the logical design phase, each entity becomes a table and each attribute becomes a column 
Tables and columns are revised in subsequent steps 

As tables and columns are specified, primary keys are selected 
Primary keys must be unique and NOT NULL and thus correspond to unique and required attributes 
Primary Keys should also be: 
**Stable**
	Primary key values should not change 
	If primary key value changes, statements that specify the old value must also change 
	New primary key value must cascade to matching foreign key 
**Simple**
	Primary key values should be easy to type and store 
	Small values are easy to specify in an SQL WHERE clause and speed up query processing 
		eg. 2-byte integer is easier to process then a 15-byte Char
**Meaningless**
	Primary keys should not contain descriptive information 
	Descriptive information occasionally changes, so primary keys containing descriptive information are unstable 

Stable, Simple, Meaningless Keys are desirable but not required

Solid bullets (‚óè) denote primary key columns 

### Implementing Strong Entities 
Strong entity becomes a strong table 
Primary key must be unique and NOT NULL, and should be stable, simple, and meaningless 
Single-Column primary keys are best, but if no such column exists, a composite primary key may have the required properties 

**Artificial Key**
	a single-column primary key created by the database designer when no suitable single-column or composite primary key exists 
	Usually artificial keys are integers, generated automatically by the database as new rows are inserted into the table 
	they are simple, stable, and meaningless

### Implementing Subtype Entities 
Subtype entities become **Subtype Tables** and are implemented as follows 
- Primary key is identical to the supertype of primary key 
- Primary key is also a foreign key that references the supertype of primary key 

### Implementing Weak Entities 
Weak entities become **Weak Tables**
Primary key is usually composite and includes: 
- Foreign key that references the primary key of the identifying table 
- Another column that makes the composite primary key unique 
	if no suitable column is available in the weak table, an artificial column can be created 

If the identifying relationship is one-one, maximum, the second column is unnecessary and the primary key includes the foreign key only 

The foreign key implements the identifying relationship and usually has the following referential integrity actions 
- Cascade on primary key update and delete 
- Restrict on foreign key insert and update 

On table diagrams, parentheses enclose composite primary key columns. An arrow between two tables indicate a foreign key
