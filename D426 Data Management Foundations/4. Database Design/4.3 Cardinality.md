### Relationship Maximum 
**Cardinality** 
	refers to maxima and minima of relationships and attributes

	A relationship has 2 Maxima, one for each of the related entities 
	usually specified as one or many 
	**Singular** when maximum is one 
	**Plural** when maximum is many

### Unique Attributes 
Each value of a **unique attribute** describes at most one entity instance 
A unique attribute is not the same as a singular attribute 
- Unique attribute has at most one entity instance for each attribute value 
- A singular attribute has at most one attribute value for each entity instance 
In ER diagrams, 1 indicates a unique attribute, M indicates non-unique attribute, the 1 or M appears before the attribute maximum and minimum
