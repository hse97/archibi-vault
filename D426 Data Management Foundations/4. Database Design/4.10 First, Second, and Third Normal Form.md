### Functional Dependence 
ColA depends on ColB means that each B value is related to at most one A value 
ColA and ColB may be simple or composite 
	'A depends on B' is written B -> A 

**Functional Dependence**
	when one column depends on another 
	reflects business rules 

Functional dependence cannot be inferred from values in a table at one point in time, future updates may alter the data and it is a function of time 

**Multivalued Dependence** and **Join Dependence**
	dependencies between three or more columns
	uncommon and not discussed in this material 

### Normal Forms
**Redundancy**
	repetition of related values in a table 
	when related values are updated, all copies must be updated 
		causes queries to be slow
**Normal Forms**
	rules for designing tables with less redundancy 
	Numbered First thru Fifth 
	An additional normal form, Boyce-Codd, is an improved version of third normal form 
	Six normal forms comprise a sequence with each sucessive normal form allowing less redundancy 
Redundancy occurs when a dependence is on a column that is not unique 
Boyce-Codd normal form eliminates all dependencies on non-unique columns and, in practice, is the most important normal form 

Fourth and Fifth normal forms eliminate multi valued and join dependencies and are mainly theoretically interesting and not very practical for use 

### First Normal Form 
Every cell of a table contains exactly one value 
**First Normal Form**
	a table that in addition to having exactly one value in every cell, has a primary key 
	Two Corollaries: 
	**In first normal form tables, every non-key column depends on the primary key**
		Each primary key value appears in exactly one row 
		each non-key cell contains exactly one value 
		therefore, each primary key value relates to exactly one non-key value 
	**A first normal form table has no duplicate rows**
		Every row contains a different primary key value and therefore every row is different 

In practice dBs usually allow dpublicate rows and no PKs but those are usually temporary 
	normally normalized when put in long term dBs

First Normal Form commonly defined as: 
	Table has a primary key 
	Every non-key column depends on the primary key 
	The table cannot have dupe rows
	Every cell contains exactly one value 

### Second Normal Form 
a table is in second normal form when all non-key columns depend on the whole primary key 
	non-key columns cannot depend on part of a composite primary key 
Tables with a simple primary key are automatically in second normal form or higher 

### Third Normal Form 
Redundancy can occur in second normal form table when a non-key column depends on another non-key column 
Informally, a table is in **third normal form** when all non-key columns depend on the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key! 
A formal definition appears elsewhere in this material
