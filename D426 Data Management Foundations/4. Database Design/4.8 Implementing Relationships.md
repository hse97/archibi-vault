### Implementing Many-One Relationships 
'implement relationships' step coverts relationships into keys or tables depending on cardinality 

Many-One or One-Many become a foreign key 
- Foreign key goes in the table on 'many' side of the relationship 
- foreign key refers to primary key on the 'one' side
- Foreign key name is the primary key name with an optional prefix 

### Implementing One-One relationships 
One-One relationships become a foreign key 
- Foreign key can go in the table on either side of the relationship 
	Usually foreign key is placed in the table with fewer rows, to minimize the number of NULL values 
- Foreign key refers to the primary key on the opposite side of the relationship 
- The foreign key name is the primary key name with an optional prefix 
	Prefix is derived from the relationship name and clarifies the meaning of the foreign key 

### Implementing Many-Many Relationships 

A many-many relationship becomes a new weak table 
- new table contains two foreign keys, referring to the primary keys of the related tables 
- The primary key of the new table is the composite of the two foreign keys
- The new table is identified by the related tables, so primary key cascade and foreign key restricts rules are specified 
- New table name consists of the related table names with an optional qualifier in between. The qualifier is derived from the relationship name and clarifies the meaning of the table
