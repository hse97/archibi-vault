### Joins 
reports are commonly generated from data in multiple tables
multi-table reports are written with join statements 

**Join**
	a SELECT statement that combines data from 2 tables known as left table and right table into a single result 
	the tables are combined by comparing columns of the left and right tables
		columns must have comparable data types
	typically compares foreign key of one table to primary key to another table but can be used to compare any column with any comparable data types

### Prefixes and Aliases 
when join tables contain columns with the same name, names need to be distinguished with a pre-fix 
	pre-fix is the table name followed by a period 

using a pre-fix amkes column names more complex
to simplify, a column name can be replaced with an alias. The alias follows the column name, separated by an optional **AS** keyword

### Inner and Full Joins
join clauses determine how a join query handles unmatched rows 
2 common join clauses are: 
**INNER JOIN**
	select only matching left and right table rows 
**FULL JOIN**
	selects all left and right table rows, regardless of match 

In a FULL JOIN results table, unmatched table rows are paired with a NULL value

### Left and Right Joins
sometimes you need to be able to see umatched rows on either left or right table but not both 

**LEFT JOIN**
	selects all left table rows but only matches right table rows
**RIGHT JOIN**
	selects all right table rows but only matches left table rows 

**OUTER JOIN**
	any join that selects unmatched rows
	 Includes left, right, and full joins

### Alternative Join Queries 
Inner and Outer Joins can be written without a JOIN clause 
	however it clarifies join behavior and is convention to use them

**UNION**
	combines two results into one table
