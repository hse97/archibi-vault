**subquery**, also called nested query or inner query, is a query within another SQL query 
typically used in a SELECT statement's WHERE clause to return data to the outer query and restrict the selected results

### Correlated Subqueries
a subquery is **correlated** when it references the outer query 
in correlated subquery, rows selected depend on what row is currently being examined by the outer query 

If a column name in the correlated subquery is identical to a column name in the outer query, the TableName.ColumnName differentiates the columns. 
	Ex. City.CountryCode refers to the City table's CountryCode column. 

An Alias can also help differentiate the columns. An alias is a temporary name assigned to a column or a name

### EXISTS Operator 
commonly used in subqueries
returns TRUE if subquery selects at least one row and FALSE If no rows selected
**NOT EXISTS**
	returns TRUE if no rows selected
	FALSE if at least one row is selected

### Flattening Subqueries 
many subqueries can be rewritten as a join which are more efficient 
	this is called **flattening**

most subqueries that follow IN or EXISTS, or return a single value, can be flattened. 
most subqueries that follow NOT EXISTS or contain a GROUP BY clause cannot be flattened
