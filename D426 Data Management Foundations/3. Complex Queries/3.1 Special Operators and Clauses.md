ID### IN Operator 
The **IN** operator is used in a WHERE clause to determine if a value matches one of several values 
```
SELECT * 
FROM CountryLanguage 
WHERE Language IN ('Dutch', 'Kongo', 'Albanian');
```

### BETWEEN Operator 
Provides alternative way to determine if a value is between two other values 
`value BETWEEN minValue AND maxValue`
	equivalent to `value >= minValue AND value <= maxValue`

used in a WHERE Clause, matches text against a pattern using the two wildcard characters % and __
	% matches any number of characters 
		`LIKE 'L%T' 
			Will match things like 'Lt' or "Lot" or 'Lol Cat' 
	__ matches exactly one character 
		`LIKE 'L_t'
			will match things like 'Lot' or 'Lit' but not 'Loot' or 'Lt'

	case-sensitive if followed by **BINARY** keyword

to search for wildcard charcters like % use a backslash ( \\ )
	`a\%` matches 'a%'
