### Aggregate Functions 
processes values from a set of rows and returns a summary value 
Common Aggregate Functions are: 
**COUNT()**
	counts number of rows in a set 
**MIN()**
	finds minimum value in the set 
**MAX()***
	finds the maximum value of the set 
**SUM()**
	sums all values in the set 
**AVG()**
	computes the arithmetic mean of all the values in the set 

### GROUP BY clause 
aggregate functions commonly used with GROUP BY clause 

combines simple or composite values into a group 
aggregate functions compute groups separately and return one row for each group 

### HAVING Clause 
used with the GROUP BY clause to filter group results 

### Aggregate Functions and NULL values
aggregate functions ignore NULL values 
	SUM(Salary) adds all non-NULL salaries together

Aggregate and Arithmetic operators handle NULL differently 
	Arithmetic return NULL when either operand is NULL 
	Aggregate have wildly different returns based on the NULL operand
