Views restructure table columns and data types without changes to the underlying database design 

**View Table**
	table name associated with a SELECT statement called the **view query**
**CREATE VIEW**
	creates view table and specifies the view name, query, and optionally, column names 
		if col names not specified, assumed same names as table being pulled from

### Querying Views
table specified in the view Query's FROM clause is called a **base table**
usually VIEW TABLES data are not stored, just presented for users 

**Materialized View**
	view in which the data is stored for long term use 
	when a base table changes, corresponding view tables update so Materialized Views update 

### Advantages of Views
**Protect Sensitive Data**
**Save Complex Queries**
**Save Optimized Queries**

### Inserting, Updating, and Deleting Views 
view tables commonly used in SELECT statement. 
Using views in INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements is problematic 

**Primary Keys**
	if a base table primary key does not appear in a view, an insert to the view generates a NULL Primary key value. Since primary keys can not be NULL the insert is not allowed
**Aggregate Values**
	view query may contain aggregate functions such as AVG() or SUM(). One aggregate value corresponds to many base table values. An update or insert to the view may create a new aggregate value, which must be converted to many base table values. 
**Join Views**
	in a join view, foreign keys of one of the base tables may match primary key of another. A delete from a view might delete foreign key row, or primary key, or both. The effect of the join view delete is undefined and therefore not allowed 

Because of these limitations, most relational databases limit or disallow view table inserts, updates, and deletes. 

### WITH CHECK OPTION Clause
Databases that allow view updates may create a row that does not satisfy the view query WHERE clause 
In these cases, the inserted or updated row does not appear in the view table 
	causes the user to think the insert/update clauses failed, even tho the base tables have changed 

**WITH CHECK OPTION**
	clause that when specified, database rejects inserts and updates that do not satisfy the view query WHERE clause
	generates an error message if fails
