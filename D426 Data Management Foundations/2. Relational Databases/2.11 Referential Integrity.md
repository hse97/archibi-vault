### Referential Integrity Rule 
A **fully NULL** foreign key is a simple or composite foreign key in which all columns are NULL. 
**Referential Integrity** is a relational rule that requires foreign key values are either fully NULL or match some primary key value. 

Foreign keys must obey referential integrity at all times. Occasionally, data errors or incomplete data results in referential integrity violations. Violations must be corrected before data is stored in the database. 

Basically in all databases, a foreign key is going to have data for every column in the foreign key, or null for every row not mixed


### Referential Integrity Violations
Can be violated in 4 ways: 
1. Primary key is updated
2. Foreign key is updated
3. row containing primary key is deleted
4. row containing foreign key is deleted


### Referential Integrity Actions
insert, update, and delete that violate referential integrity can be corrected manually 
	error prone and time consuming

Can automatically correct referential integrity violations with any of four actions, specified as SQL constraints 

**Restrict**
	reject an insert, update, or delete that violates referential integrity 
**SET NULL**
	set invalid foreign keys to NULL
**SET DEFAULT**
	set invalid foreign keys to the foreign key default 
**CASCADE**
	propagates primary key changes to foreign key 

CASCADE behaves differently for primary key updates and deletes. If a primary key is deleted, rows containing matching foreign keys are deleted. If a primary key is updated, matching foreign keys are updated to the same value.

### ON UPDATE and ON DELETE clauses 
MySQL supports only RESTRICT for foreign key inserts and updates 
Foreign key inserts and updates that violate referential integrity are automatically rejected 

For Primary Key updates and deletes, MySQL supports all four actions. Actions are specified in the optional **ON UPDATE**  and **ON DELETE** clauses of the **FOREIGN KEY**

**ON UPDATE** and **ON DELETE** determine what happens to the foreign key when the referenced primary key is updated or deleted. When several foreign keys refer to the same primary key, different actions can be specified for each foreign key. 

MySQL has several limitations on primary key updates and deletes. 
- RESTRICT is applied by default when ON UPDATE or ON DELETE is omitted 
- SET NULL cannot be used when a foreign key is not allowed NULL values 
- SET DEFAULT is not supported in some MySQL configurations

ON UPDATE and ON DELETE are standard SQL. The clauses are supported by most relational databases, but details and limitations vary.
