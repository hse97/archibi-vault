### Database Model
conceptual framework for database systems, 3 parts
	Data Structure
		Prescribe how data is organized
	Operations
		Manipulate data structures
	Rules
		govern valid data 

**Relational Model**
	database model based on tabular data structure

### Relational Data Structure
Relational data structure is based on set theory 
**Set**
	unordered collection of elements, enclosed in braces 
		`{a, b, c}` is same as `{c,b,a}` because set is unordered
**Tuple**
	ordered collection of elements, enclosed in parenthesis
		`(a,b,c)` is NOT the same as `(c,b,a)` because tuples are ordered

Data structure organizes data in tables: 
	Table
		Has name, fixed tuple of columns, varying set of rows 
	Column
		Has a name and a data type
	Row
		unnamed tuple of values
		Each value corresponds to a column and belongs to the column's data type 
		Queries can select rows by specifying one or more row values 
	Data Type
		Named set of values
		Where column values are drawn
Tables are Sets of Rows, the Rows have no inherent order
	It is a set of Tuples
	The order of the rows may change, but the column values of those rows does not change

Terms Table, Column, Row, and Data Type are commonly used in data processing circles
Relation, Attribute, Tuple, and Domain are equivalent mathematical terms 
File, Field, Record, and Data Type are similar terms for file processing 

### Relational Operations 
Also based on set theory. Each operation generates a result table from one or two input tables. 

**Select**
	selects subset of rows of a table 
**Project**
	eliminates one or more columns of a table from selection 
**Product**
	lists all combinations of rows of two tables
**Join**
	Combines two tables by comparing related columns 
**Union**
	Selects all rows of two tables
**Intersect**
	Select rows common to two tables
**Difference**
	Select rows that appear in one table but not another
**Rename**
	change table name
**Aggregate**
	Computes functions over multiple table rows, such as sum and count

These are collectively called **Relational Algebra** 
	theoretical foundation of SQL
	since the result of relational operations are always a table, the results of an SQL query are always a table 

### Relational Rules 
logical constraints to ensure data validity 
part of the relational model and govern data in every relational database 

**Unique Primary Key**
	all tables have primary key column, or group of columns, in which values are unique and do not repeat
**Unique Column Name**
	different columns of the same table have different names
**No duplicate rows**
	No two rows of the same table have identical values in all columns 

**Business Rules**
	based on business policy, specific to particular business/database 
		Ex: All rows on employee table must have unique and valid ID number
	Discovered during database design 

**Constraints**
	SQL constraints enforced by the database system 
	based on relational rules
