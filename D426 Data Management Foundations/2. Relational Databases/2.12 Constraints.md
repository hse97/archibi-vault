### Column and Table Constraints 
A **constraint** is a rule that governs allowable values in a database. 
	based on relational and business rules
	implemented with special key words in CREATE TABLE statement
	dB automatically rejects insert, update, and delete statements that violate a constraint. 

Following constraints will be discussed
	NOT NULL 
	DEFAULT 
	PRIMARY KEY
	FOREIGN KEY 

**Column Constraint** appears after the column name and data type in a CREATE TABLE statement. Column constraints govern values in a single column. Ex. NOT NULL is a column constraint. 

A **Table Constraint** appears in a separate clause of a CREATE TABLE statement and governs values in one or more columns.

### UNIQUE Constraint 
ensures that values in a column, or group of columns, are unique. 
	When applied to a single column, unique may appear either in the column declaration or as a separate clause
	when applied to a group of columns, UNIQUE is a table constraint and must appear as a separate clause 

### CHECK Constraint 
specifies an expression on one or more columns of a table 
CHECK's to see if the expression evaluates to TRUE, FALSE, or NULL

### Constraint Names
table constraints can be named using the optional **CONSTRAINT** keyword followed by the constraint name and declaration 
	no name provided, database generates a default name 
	constraint names appear in error messages when violations occur

### Adding and Dropping Constraints 
Constraints added/dropped with `ALTER TABLE TableName` followed by `ADD, DROP, or CHANGE`  clause 

	`- `CHANGE CurrentColumnName NewColumnName NewDataType [ConstraintDeclaration]``
