### Operators 
Symbol that computes a value from one or more other values called **operands**
	Arithmetic operators compute numeric values from numeric operands
		either unary or binary  
	Comparison operators compute logical values TRUE or FALSE 
		Operands may be numeric, character, or other data types
	Logical Operators compute logical values from logical operands
		are NOT unary 
**Unary**
	operator with one operand
**Binary**
	operator has two operands 
	most operators are binary 

Operators may return NULL when either operand is NULL.

### Expressions
String of operators and operands, and parentheses that evaluate to a single value 
	`Salary > 3400 AND Department = 'Marketing'` is an expression 
Can execute expressions using column names to get results for every column value in table 

**Operator Precedence**
	order of operations for expressions

Table 2.6.2: Operator precedence.

|Precedence|Operators|
|---|---|
|1|- (unary)|
|2|^|
|3|*     /     %|
|4|+     - (binary)|
|5|=     !=     <     >     <=     >=|
|6|NOT|
|7|AND|
|8|OR|

### SELECT statement
selects rows from a table 
statement **SELECT** clause and a **FROM** clause. FROM clause specifies the table from which rows are selected. The SELECT clause specifies one or more expressions, separated by commas, that determine what values are returned for each row. 
returns a set of rows called the **results tab**

### WHERE Clause
Experssions may return value of any data type 
**Condition**
	expression that evaluates to a logical value 
**WHERE**
	clause that specifies a condition for selecting a row 
	row selected when the condition is TRUE for the row values.
