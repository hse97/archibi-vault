HTML defines structure and content with elements. 
Almost all HTML pages are just pieces of content wrapped in opening and closing HTML tags. 
	Opening tags `<>`tell the browser its the start of an element
		Opening tag for a paragraphs `<p>` 
	Closing tags tell the browser the element has ended 
		Closing tag for a paragraph `</p>`
	`<p> some text content </p>`

### Void Elements
some elements do not have a closing tag just a single tag 
	`<br>` and `<img>`
