### Designing for Mobile Browsers
Considerations for designing for mobile
- screen size is smaller
- touch screens, not mouse
- limited/slower internet 
- data plans 
- different purpose for accessing on mobile device
- limited memory/cpu speed
- can use gps/accelerometer data

### Implementing mobile websites 
Developers implement mobile sites in 3 main ways: 
1. Separate Websites 
2. Dynamic server
	Same URL but back end sends desktop and mobile versions to clients
3. Responsive web design 
	web server sends back same HTML but browser alter appearance to match device size

When sending a HTTP GET request, device sends a User Agent string that tells the webserver what type of site to respond with 

### Responsive Web Design 
Responsive Web Design (RWD) is a collection of techniques that adapt to the browsers size 
sends same HTML to Desktop and mobile
1. elements are laid out on fluid, proportion-based grids that use relative units like percentages instead of absolute units like pixels
2. Images are sized with relative units to adapt to various screen sizes
3. CSS media queries apply different CSS styles depending on browser's width 

RWD allows devs to create 1 webpage that works on both desktop + mobile
