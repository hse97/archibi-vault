Viewport
	visible area of a webpage, not including the address bar, bookmark bar, tabs, etc 

screens used to be rendered assuming  ~1000px width 
mobile devies typically pretend to be 980px in width 

viewport meta element specifies viewport properties that affect what the browser's viewport display

`width` - viewport width 
`initial-scale` - initial zoom level, which is typically set to 1 so the webpage initially zoomed in at 100% 
`user-scalable` - boolean value, when `user-scalable: no` prevents zooming in/out

viewport properties are set in the `<meta>` element's `content` attribute separated by commas 
	`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`

### Viewport Units
Devs frequently want elements to take up a fixed percentage of the viewport 

Viewport unit (`vw` and `vh`)
	percentage of the browser's viewport's width and height, where 1vw = 1% of viewport width and 1vh = 1% of viewport height. 
	CSS also defines minimum and maximum viewport units vmin and vmax where 1 vmin = 1vw or 1vh whichever is smaller and 1vmax = 1vw or 1vh whichever is larger 
basically 1% of the viewport size = 1 vh or vw
