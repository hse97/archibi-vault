CSS Units are used to define page element length like font-size, height, width, border, among other properties
	length is represented by a number (integer or decimal), or percentages. 
numbers can be positive or negative 
	negative means the element in the box model will collapse the margin 

### Absolute Units 
consist of the actual physical measurements that are fix
	not related to other properties 

|**Name**|**Unit**|**Comparable** **to**|
|---|---|---|
|Centimeters|cm|1cm = 96px/2.54|
|Millimeters|mm|1mm = 1/10th of 1cm|
|Quarter-millimeters|Q|1Q = 1/40th of 1cm|
|Inches|in|1in = 2.54cm = 96px|
|Picas|pc|1pc = 1/16th of 1in|
|Points|pt|1pt = 1/72th of 1in|
|Pixels|px|1px = 1/96th of 1in|
### Relative Units
define length based on another relative length property like font, size of viewport, etc 
relative units are good for mobile as it automatically changes the sizing dynamically based on screen size

|Unit|Relative to|
|---|---|
|em|font-size of the element (2em equal 2 times the size of the actual font)|
|ex|x-height of the actual font|
|ch|width of the zero|
|rem|font-size of the root element|
|vw|1% of the width of the viewport|
|vh|1% of the height of the viewport|
|vmin|1% of viewportâ€™s smaller dimension|
|vmax|1% of viewport's larger dimension|
|%|Fraction of parent element|
