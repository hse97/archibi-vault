Specificity determines which style rules take precedence when multiple rules target the same element 
Not all selectors have the same level of specificity 
	certain selectors will always take precedence regardless of position 
Generally it goes: 
1. ID Selector
2. Class Selector
3. Element Selector
4. Inline Styles
