### Intro to CSS
CSS describes how webpage is styled/presented 
CSS Rule
	consists of selector followed by declaration block between braces {}
Selector
	specifies the HTML element that the rule applies to 
Declaration Block
	area inside braces with all the style declarations;
Declarations
	the actual CSS property, value, and semi-colon;
```
h1 {
  color: black;
}
```
h1 - selector
{...} - declaration block 
color: black; - declaration 

### Applying CSS
CSS can be applied to HTML in 3 ways
1. Inline Style
	Places CSS declarations inside an element's style attribute 
2. Embedded Stylesheet 
	Places CSS rules in an HTML document head using a `<style>` element 
3. External style sheet 
	Places CSS in separate file that is imported into the CSS document with `<link>` element
		`<link href="stylesheet.css" rel="stylesheet">`

### Inheritance and Conflict 
Browsers have a default stylesheet they use and declarations override that

Inheritance
	style declarations for parent elements cascade down and apply to children elements 
	each element inherits the style of their parent 
	elements inherit up and up all the way to the `<body>` element 

Conflict
	when two style declarations with identical properties apply to the same element 
		A parent style declaration conflicts with child style declaration 
			Child style > parent style 
		embedded or linked styling conflicts with inline styling 
		Inline style > embedded/linked style 
	The further nested you go, the styling usually takes priority
