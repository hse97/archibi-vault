### Element, Class, and ID Selectors
Three common selectors:
Element Selector
	matches elements with the specific element name 
	Ex: `p {color: blue;}` 
		Selects all `p` elements and makes them blue

Class Selector
	matches elements that have specified class 
	specified with a ( . ) character 
	Ex: `.notice {color: blue;}` 
		all elements with `class="notice"` attribute will be blue

ID Selector
	matches the element with the specific ID 
		elements can only have one unique ID, this applies only to 1 element 
	specified with a ( # ) character
		Ex: `#byLine {color: blue;}` 
			selects element with `id="byLine"` attribute and makes it blue

Classes
	Allow devs to specify elements to belong to a group, a class 
	elements can have more then 1 class
		separated with a space during declaration 
			`class="highlight first"` would set an element to have a class of highlight and first 
	IDs are element specific, classes are communal 

### Descendant  Selector 
It's a way to select items that only reside in other items
denoted with a space between selection 
	`h2 em {color: blue;}`
		Selects every `em` element that is nested inside an `h2` element

### Pseudo-Class Selector
matches elements based on user behavior or element metainformation 
specified with a `:` followed by pseudo-class name 

Examples
	`:disable`
		Element disabled
	`:hover`
		mouse is hover over element
	`:empty`
		element has no children elements
	`:lang(language)` 
		element contains text in a specific language 
	`:nth-child(n)` element is the parent element's nth child 

Class selectors and pseudo-class selectors can combine with the element to match more specific elements
	Ex: `a:hover` selects only the anchor elements that the mouse is hovering over
