### Paragraphs 
`<p>...</p>` tags crates a paragraph element 
	browsers visually separate paragraphs with spacing above and below 

#### White Space and Line Breaks 
white space is an unprinted character such as the spaces between words and lines of text 
browsers treat all sequences of white space as a single space between non-whitespace characters 
`<br>` element creates a line break , content after this element appears on new line 
	void element so no closing tag 
	typically best to not use for formatting purposed. CSS is better can cause issues via hardcoding
