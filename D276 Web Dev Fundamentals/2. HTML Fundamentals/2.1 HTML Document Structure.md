HTML Has over 130 Elements 
Elements are represented with tags 
tag is a markup instruction indentified by `<tag name> `
	opening and closing tags common but not always
a *void* element is an element that only needs 1 tag
	`<img>` and `<br>` are void elements they do not have closing tags 
	do not wrap any content 

### HTML Document
HTML Living Standard as per WHATWG defines the minimal parts of an HTML document: 
1.  `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration instructs web browser about what type of document follows 
2. `<html>` element encloses everything but the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration 
	Usually declares the language of the webpage `<html lang="en">` 
3.  `<head>` contains doc title, doc meta data, various other elements not displayed on the webpage 
4. `<meta>` meta data 
	`<meta charset="UTF-8">` describes how characters are represented in the HTML document 
5. `<title>` document's name. Displayed in browser's tab bar, used by search engines for bookmarking
6. `<body>` encloses all elements that will be rendered on the webpage 

Omitting the DOCTYPE header or having any renderables before the DOCTYPE header causes the browser to render it in Quirks mode. 
	Browser rendering type that emulates older engines 

Typically renders webpages in Standard mode with the HTML living standard in mind
