`<img>` is a void element, no closing tag, that displays an image in a webpage 
has 2 HTML Living Standard attributes
	`src` specifies the URL to the image
	`alt` provides alt info if the image can't load
		`<img srd="https://example.com/family.jpg" alt="Family">`
Not required but good form 

#### Image Size
`width` and `height` are optional `<img>` attributes but helps formatting
	`<img src="logo.png" alt="Logo" width="200" height="100">`
