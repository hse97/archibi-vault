#### Anchor Element
`<a>Anchor</a>` anchor element defines hyperlink on a webpage 
	`href` attributes specifies the URL to the hyperlink
		`<a href ="https://wikipedi.org/">Wiki</a>`

#### Absolute and Relative URLs
Absolute
	complete URL
Relative URL
	relative path to the web resource 
	assumes current directory unless more specifically stated
		use `href="../index.html"` to go up one directory 
			`../../` etc to go up as many dirs. as needed

#### Section Links
URLs can point to fragments by adding # to the end of the URL 
	`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science#History`
		points directly to #history section in the page

Adding an ID attribute to any element creates a fragment identifier that allows URLs to link directly to the ID location 
###### Rules for ID Attribute Names
1. Can be composed of any characters except white space
2. cannot start with a number i.e `3section`
3. Is case sensitive 
4. Must be unique in the document 

Good practice is to choose id values that start with a letter and are composed of only letters, digits, dashes (-), and underscores ( _ ). Ex: "history123-late"

#### Image Links and Targets
Content of a hyperlink may be any valid HTML or text 
graphical hyperlink or image link uses an imagine inside of a hyperlink instead of text
pulls an image from a page
	`<a href="http://akc.org/"><img src="dog.jpg" alt="Dog Picture"></a>`
Lets you have images without directly hosting the file 

`target` attribute in the `<a>..</a>` anchor element indicates how the browser should display the link when clicked
	`__self` attribute is default and opens the link in the same tab or window
	`__blank` attribute value indicates browser will open link in a new tab or window
