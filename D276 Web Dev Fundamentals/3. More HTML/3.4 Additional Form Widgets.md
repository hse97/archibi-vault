### Fallbacks and Polyfills
Not all widgets and attributes are fully supported by all browsers. Ex: Older browsers may not show a color input picker, so users must instead enter a hex string representing the red, green, and blue values of the color, like `#4268D3`, into a text input field.

A fallback is a mechanism that allows a webpage element to function correctly even if the browser does not support a particular element. Good practice is to implement a fallback mechanism if a particular widget is not widely supported by browsers at the time.

A polyfill is a fallback using JavaScript code that makes certain HTML features (Ex: the date picker) work on browsers that do not natively support those features. Developers often use a JavaScript library such as Modernizr to detect which features the browser does not support, and then load one or more polyfills to provide fallback mechanisms for the non-supported features.
