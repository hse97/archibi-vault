| `<aside>`   | Container for content not directly related to the main topic of a document                               |
| `<div>`     | Generic element for creating block containers                                                            |

#### Block Elements 
Elements can be categorized as either block or inline. 
A block element (sometimes called a block-level element) fills the width of the element's parent container and can contain other block elements
	`<h1>, <table>, <p>` are examples of block elements
Some block elements can't have certain other elements in it
	for instance `<p>` cannot have another `<p>` in it
`<div>` is a generic block element that has no semantic meaning

#### Inline Elements
Fill the minimum space possible in the element's parent container
`<a>` anchor elements are an inline element
`<span>` is a generic inline element with no semantic meaning
