### Flex Items and Properties
Flex item's width is determined by the combination of three CSS properties: 

`flex-basis:` 
	sets initial length of item
	`auto` by default, can be a percentage, or a length unit
		`auto` is same length as actual content

`flex-grow:`
	sets a proportion that determines how much of the available container space should be assigned to the item 
	default `0` meaning size should be based on content in item

`flex-shrink:
	sets a proportion that determines the items' minimum size
	default is `1` meaning it should shrink at same rate as everything else
		`0` would be does not shrink
