### The Position Property 
`position:` property gives more control over element's placement 
4 possible values
`static` 
	default positioning 
`relative`
	positions the element relative to the default position 
`fixed`
	positions element in fixed location relative to viewport
`absolute`
	positions the element relative to the nearest positioned ancestor

`relative` position is exactly that, relative to the perspective of the grid item 
	`position: relative; left: 30px` would be 30 pixels to the right
	`position: relative; top: -10px;` would be 10 pixels higher 

### Fixed Positioning 
`position: fixed`
places element at fixed location in the viewport 
scrolling does not move the element
viewport
	visible area of a webpage 
fixed elements are lifted on a layer above the pages contents.

### Absolute Property 
Absolute positioning is similar to fixed positioning except: 
1. position based on nearest ancestor element that uses absolute or relative positioning 
	if no position ancestor element exists, the element is positioned relative to the document body 
2. An absolute-positioned element scrolls with the document unless an ancestor element is using fixed positioning 

### Z-Index Property 
When a relative, absolute, or fixed element is placed on top of each other, the element specified last in the HTML is placed on top 

`z-index:` 
	property used to specify a relative distance that orders the appearance of elements 
	Elements with higher z-index values are placed on top of elements with lower z-index values
