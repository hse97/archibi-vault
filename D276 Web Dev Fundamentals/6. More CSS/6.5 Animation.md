### Animation and Keyframes
###### CSS Animation 
transforms an element's style over time 
3 advantages over JS animations
1. do not require any JS code
2. put less load on machines
3. more efficient on the browser's controls
###### @keyframes 
defines a CSS animation's behavior 
###### keyframe list 
has names and contains keyframes and properties and values that will be animated 
`from` 
	the animation starting state that lists CSS properties and values that apply when the animation begins
`to`
	animation ending state that lists the CSS properties and values that the "from" values become by the time the animation ends 

Percentages may be used to specify keyframes at various points during the animation 
	`0%` is equivalent to `from` and `100%`  is equivalent to `to`

To create an animation 2 CSS properties must be defined: 
	`animation-name:` names the keyframe
	`animation-duration:` length of the animation in seconds (s) or ms 

animations begin immediately unless `animation-delay` is used 

### Timing, Iteration Count, and Direction
`animation-timing-function:`
	controls animation speed between keyframes. Several timing functions are available. 
	`ease`
		slow start, then fast, then slow end (default)
	`lineaer`
		same speed throughout
	`ease-in`
		slow start
	`ease-out`
		slow end
	`ease-in-out`
		slow start and end
	`cubic-bezier(n1, n2, n3, n4)`
		specify numbers that control speed based on a Bezier curve 

`animation-iteration-count:`
	indicates the number of times the animation will run. 

`animation-direction:`
	indications animation direction
	`normal`
	`reverse`
	`alternate` - alternates between normal and reverse
	`alternate-reverse` - alternate between reverse and normal 

`animation:`
	shorthand for declaring animation name, duration, timing function, delay, iteration count, and direction. 
		`animation: move 3s linear 2s infinite normal`

### Transitions
CSS Transitions animate an element's transition from one state to another when CSS property changes value
transitions are commonly used with the `:hover` pseudo-class 

Differ from animations in 2 ways:
1. executes when an element's property values are changed 
2. provide less control over the animations then CSS animations

`transition:` 
	defines a transition by specifying one or more CSS properties and each peroperty's transition duration 

`transition-timing-function:`
	`ease` - slow start, then fast, then slow finish
	`linear` - same speed throughout 
	`ease-in` - slow start
	`ease-out` - slow end 
	`easin-in-out` - slow start and end
	`cubic-bezier(n1, n2, n3, n4)` - specifies numbers based on wtf a Bezier curve is 

`transition-delay`
	delays transition's start

### Transformations
`transform:` 
applies a 2D or 3D transformation to an element. A transformation is a graphical operation that alters the position, shape, or orientation of an object. 

|Function|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|translate(x, y)|Moves an element on the x-axis `x` distance and along the y-axis `y` distance|/* Moves right 10px and up 20px */<br>translate(10px, -20px)|
|scale(x, y)|Increases (values > 1) or decreases (values < 1) the width and height by the `x` and `y` multiplier|/* Halves the width, doubles the height */<br>scale(0.5, 2)|
|rotate(angle)|Rotates clockwise by `angle`|/* Rotates clockwise 45 degrees */<br>rotate(45deg)|
