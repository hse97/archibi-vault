### Intro to HTTP
HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
	networking protocol over TCP/IP
	governs communication between web browsers and web servers 

Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)

DNS Lookup
	device sends domain to DNS server to obtain IP 
	Uses IP to establish TCP/IP connection with web server and communicates in HTTP 

HTTP Request
	message to recieve the HTML file and any resources that are called in the HTML file 
	usually 1 request for every resource + the intial HTML grab

HTTP Response 
	A reply to the requests
	usually one for every request 1:1 ratio 

### Request and Response Headers
HTTP request and response both composed of four parts 
1. Start Line 
	Specifies the HTTP version being used 
	Request Start Line: type and path 
	Response Start Line: Status Code and Phrase
2. Header Field 
	Zero or more per response/request
	keyword followed by colon and value 
	supply addlt info about the request/response 
3. blank line 
4. Message Body 
	contains data being transferred between a web browser and web server

Common Headers:

Content-Type
	Number of bytes in the response's message body
Content-Type
	Media type of the response's message body
Date
	Datetime the response was generated by the web server
Last-modified
	datetime the requested resource was last modified by the webserver
Server
	Identifies the server software that generates the response 
		Apache, Nginx, Microsoft-IIS
Host
	Domain name for the requested path 
User-Agent
	Identifies the browser making the request

Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) 
	Org that standardizes these things 


### Chrome DevTools for watching HTTP Traffic
`Ctrl + Shift + I` to open up 
Network Tab
	The first request should be the HTML file for whatever webpage being loaded

### Request Methods and Response Status Codes
Request Method 
	indicates desired action to perform on a resource

###### Common HTTP Request Methods
Get

HEAD

PUT

304

403
	Forbidden
404
	Not Found
500

### Browser Caching 
Browser Cache
	area on the device's file system where web content can be stored for quick retrieval 

Entity Tag (ETag)
	identifies specific version of a web resource 
	When a browser requests a cached resource, it sends an ETag request 
	If a resource is cached, it is assigned an ETag in the local device and in the web server
1. The browser requests uncached resource test.html. The web server returns the contents of test.html back to the browser where test.html is cached.
2. The second request for cached test.html includes the ETag 123abc.
3. The web server compares ETags and notes the file has not changed, so 304 is returned with no HTML. The browser displays the cached content.
4. test.html is modified on the web server and assigned a new ETag.
5. The browser sends a third request for test.html with ETag 123abc.
6. The web server compares ETags and notes the file has changed, so 200 is returned with new HTML and ETag.
7. The browser displays the new content and updates the browser cache.
